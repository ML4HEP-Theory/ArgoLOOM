Left-Right Symmetric Models\nThe minimal LRSM which extends the SM gauge symmetry to SU(2)L ×SU(2)R ×\nU(1)B−L [24, 25, 295] provides a simple UV-complete seesaw model, where the key\ningredients of seesaw, i.e. the RH neutrinos and their Majorana masses, appear\nnaturally. The presence of RH neutrinos is a necessary ingredient for the restoration of\nLeft-Right symmetry and is also required by anomaly cancellation, whereas the seesaw\nscale is identiﬁed as the breaking of the SU(2)R symmetry. It is worth noting that in\nthe presence of three RH neutrinos, the (B−L)-symmetry which was a global symmetry\nin the SM becomes a gauge symmetry in the LRSM, as the gauge anomalies cancel by\nsatisfying the condition Tr(B−L)3 = 0. Moreover, the electric charge formula takes a\nform similar to the Gell-Mann - Nishijima relation: Q= I3L + I3R + (B−L)/2, where\nI3L and I3R are the third components of isospin under SU(2)L and SU(2)R respectively,\nand the SM hypercharge can now be understood as Y/2 = I3R + (B−L)/2 [296,297].\nIn the LRSM, leptons are assigned to the multiplets Lℓ = (νℓ,ℓ)L and Rℓ = (Nℓ,ℓ)R\n(where ℓ = e,µ,τ is the generation index) with the quantum numbers ( 2,1,−1) and\n(1,2,−1) respectively under SU(2)×SU(2)×U(1)B−L.

The BRPV\nmodel is the simplest one [44–53], and has several interesting consequences that can be\nprobed at collider experiments (see e.g. [385–387]). Since the distinction between the\nmatter doublet superﬁelds ˆLi and the Higgs doublet superﬁelds ˆHd, ˆHu is lost in these\nmodels, it allows the mixing of neutrinos and neutralinos, sleptons and Higgs bosons,\ncharged leptons and charginos. One linear combination of neutrino ﬁelds develops a\nMajorana mass at tree-level via mixing with Higgsinos, while the other combinations\ncan acquire masses at loop-level via the trilinear couplings.

Conclusions and Outlook\nThe discovery of neutrino oscillations has provided us with the ﬁrst conclusive\nexperimental evidence for the existence of new physics beyond the SM. Therefore,\njust as the postulate of the very existence of the neutrino led to the formulation of\nthe theory of weak interactions, an essential ingredient for the stupendous success of\nthe SM, a clear understanding of the neutrino mass mechanism could as well be the\nﬁrst beacon of physics beyond the SM. Therefore, it is very important to explore the\nexperimental signatures of various neutrino mass models to pin down the underlying\nnew physics. In this brief review, we have discussed some low-scale neutrino mass\nmechanisms accessible to current and future experiments. In particular, we focused on\nthe simplest Type-I seesaw model and summarized the current experimental constraints\non the sterile neutrino mass and its mixing with active neutrinos. We have discussed\nthe future discovery prospects of a heavy neutrino, within the minimal setup as well\nas involving extended gauge/Higgs sectors, with a particular emphasis on the energy\nfrontier, in light of the upcoming run-II phase of the LHC and the proposed future\ncolliders at both energy and intensity frontiers.

In the ﬁrst,\none adds to the Lagrangian (5) the higher-dimensional opera tors given in Eq. (1).\nThis allows for production of DM sterile neutrinos at reheat ing after inﬂation\n[43], provided that they are heavier than 100 keV. This does n ot contradict to\nX-ray constraints because the mixing angle θ 1 is not essential for this production\nmechanism. The sterile neutrino, in this case, can only play the role of CDM\ncandidate.\nThe second modiﬁcation of the ν MSM requires the addition of a singlet scalar\nﬁeld [131]. This ﬁeld may give a mass to singlet fermions due t o Y ukawa couplings\nto these fermions, and it may play the role of the inﬂaton [131 , 132]. The decays of\nthis scalar to DM sterile neutrinos may serve as an eﬃcient me chanism of cold or\nwarm DM production, without conﬂicting with X-ray constrai nts [131, 133, 134,\n135, 136]. In such models the mass of sterile neutrino DM can b e in the MeV\nrange or even in the GeV range. The radiative decays of such DM particles can be\nsearched for with Fermi (cf. [137]), whose large FoV requires a new search strategy ."}

A ﬁnal word about astro-\nphysical applications of right-handed neutrinos, discuss ed in this work. The mean\nfree path of a sterile neutrino inside a collapsing star is mu ch larger than that\nof an ordinary neutrino. The escape of sterile neutrinos fro m the supernova may\nthus provide an eﬀective cooling mechanism. For sterile neu trinos with the masses\nM ≳ 102 keV the analysis of the data from the supernova 1987A leads to an upper\nbound on the mixing with electron neutrino sin 2(2θ e) ≲ 10−10 [138, 139, 140, 141].\nIn the case of sterile neutrinos with the mass M < 102 keV the analysis shows\nthat the mixing with the electron neutrinos is bounded by sin 2(2θ e) ≲ 10−8 ( keV\nM\n) 2\nfor 1 keV ≲ M ≲ 100 keV [139, 142], while the mixing with ν µ,τ is bounded by\nsin2(2θ µ,τ ) ≲ 3 × 10−8T −6\n30 [64] (c.f. [31]) where T30 = Tcore / 30 MeV and a typical\nsupernovae core temperatures, Tcore , lie in the range 20 −70 MeV [143]. Owing to\nlarge uncertainties in the supernova physics, the constrai nts on the mixing angle\nof the sterile neutrino that arise from these consideration s happen to be weaker\nthan the X-ray bounds discussed above (Section 5.1.2) [64, 6 5].\nAt the same time, the analysis of [144, 145] shows that steril e neutrinos with\nthe masses 1 keV ≲ M ≲ 5 keV and with the mixing angle with ν e 10−10 ≲\nsin2(2θ e) ≲ 10−8 may enhance lepton number, energy , and entropy transport in\nsupernovae explosions.

The asy mmetric emission of\nkeV sterile neutrinos from a supernova explosion may lead to an explanation of\npulsar kick velocities [147, 148, 149, 133, 134, 150], see [1 51] for a review. The\nX-ray photons from early decays of these particles can inﬂue nce the formation of\nmolecular hydrogen and can be important for the early star fo rmation and re-\nionization [152, 153, 154, 155, 156]. See also Refs. [157, 15 8, 159] for a discussion\nof the formation of super-massive black holes and degenerat e heavy neutrino stars.\nFinally , if DM consists of many components (as may occur in ex tensions of\nthe ν MSM) such that sterile neutrinos constitute only a fraction f < 1 of it, the\nX-ray bounds shown in Fig. 4 become weaker by the same factor. Moreover, the\nLyman-α constraints also become diluted [160, 67], if the rest of DM i s cold. The\nanalysis in [67] shows that the DM sterile neutrino with the s pectrum given by\nEq.

We consider sterile neutrino mass schemes involving one or two mass-squared\ndiﬀerences at the eV 2 scale denoted by 3+1, 3+2, and 1+3+1. We discuss the hints for\neV-scale neutrinos from (–)νe disappearance (reactor and Gallium anomalies) and (–)νµ →(–)νe\nappearance (LSND and MiniBooNE) searches, and we present constraints on sterile neu-\ntrino mixing from (–)νµ and neutral-current disappearance data. An explanation of all hints\nin terms of oscillations suﬀers from severe tension between appearance and disappearance\ndata. The best compatibility is obtained in the 1+3+1 scheme with a p-value of 0.2% and\nexceedingly worse compatibilities in the 3+1 and 3+2 schemes.\nKeywords: neutrino osci"}

No signiﬁcant excess is found at higher neutrino energies.\nInterpreting the data in terms of oscillations, parameter values consistent with the\nones from LSND are obtained.\n•Radioactive source experiments at the Gallium solar neutrino experiments SAGE and\nGALLEX have obtained an event rate which is somewhat lower than expected. This\neﬀect can be explained by the hypothesis of νe disappearance due to oscillations with\n∆m2 ≳ 1 eV2 [18, 19] (“Gallium anomaly”).\n•A recent re-evaluation of the neutrino ﬂux emitted by nuclear reactors [20, 21] has led\nto somewhat increased ﬂuxes compared to previous calculations [22–25].

We ﬁnd that the\nsigniﬁcance of the reactor anomaly is not aﬀected by the inclusion of LBL experiments and\nﬁnite θ13. The ∆χ2\nno-osc even slightly increases from 9.0 to 9.2 when adding LBL data to the\nSBL data (“no-osc” refers here to θ14 = 0). Hence, we do not agree with the conclusions\nof Ref. [100], which ﬁnds that the signiﬁcance of the reactor anomaly is reduced to 1 .4σ\nwhen LBL data and a ﬁnite value of θ13 is taken into account.\nSolar neutrinos are also sensitive to sterile neutrino mixing (see e.g. [101–103]). The\nmain eﬀect of the presence of νe mixing with eV states is an over-all ﬂux reduction. While\nthis eﬀect is largely degenerate with θ13, a non-trivial bound is obtained in the combination\nwith DayaBay, RENO and KamLAND. KamLAND is sensitive to oscillations driven by\n∆m2\n21 and θ12, whereas sterile neutrinos aﬀect the overall normalization, degenerate with\nθ13. The matter eﬀect in the sun as well as SNO NC data provide additional signatures\nof sterile neutrinos, beyond an overall normalization. As we will show in Sec. 4 solar data\ndepend also on the mixing anglesθ24 and θ34, controlling the fraction ofνe →νs transitions,\nsee e.g. [101].

The sensitivity of future\ntritium decay data from the KATRIN experiment has been estimated in [107]. Implications\nof sterile neutrinos for neutrino-less double beta-decay have been discussed recently in [48–\n50].\nLet us now address the question whether the presence of a sterile neutrino aﬀects the\ndetermination of the mixing angle θ13 (see also [99, 100]). In Fig. 3 we show the combined\ndetermination of θ13 and θ14 for two ﬁxed values of ∆m2\n41.

A detailed discussion of LSND DAR versus DIF in the context of 3+1\nneutrino oscillations can be found in [35].\nIn our analysis of the MiniBooNE νe and ¯νe appearance search we use the latest data7\nfrom [16], following closely the analysis instructions provided by the collaboration. Details\nare given in appendix E.4. Since their very ﬁrst data release in 2007 [13], MiniBooNE\nobserve an excess of events over expected background in the low energy ( ≲ 500 MeV)\nregion of the event spectrum [122]. Since the spectral shape of the excess is diﬃcult to\nexplain in a two-ﬂavor oscillation framework, historically the analysis window has been\n(somewhat artiﬁcially) divided into a low energy region containing the excess events and a\nhigh energy part with no excess.8 Preliminary results from anti-neutrinos showed also some\nindication for an event excess in the high energy part of the spectrum [14] which indicated\nthe need for CP violation in order to reconcile neutrino and anti-neutrino data. However,\nfor the most recent data [15, 16] the shapes of the neutrino and anti-neutrino spectra appear\nto be consistent with each other, showing excess events below around 500 MeV and data\nconsistent with background in the high energy "}

For deﬁniteness, we will focus on s = 2; the special case of\ns = 1 can be easily obtained by dropping all terms containing a redundant “5” index.\nLet us order the ﬂavor eigenstates as ( νe, νµ, ντ, νs1 , νs2 ) and introduce the following\nparametrization for the n×n mixing matrix, with n= 3 + s:\nU = V35V34V25V24V23V15V14V13V12 (A.1)\nwhere Vij represents a complex rotation by an angleθij and a phase ϕij in the ijplane.

(A.1) using Eq. (A.2), and then try to commute as many\nphase matrices to the left and the right. The matrix Dk commutes with a matrix Oij if\nk ̸= i and k ̸= j. Furthermore, if k = i or k = j we can commute Dk with a complex\nmatrix Vij by re-deﬁning the phase ϕij: e.g., Vij(θij,ϕij)Di = DiVij(θij,ϕ′\nij). However, we\ncannot commute Dk with a real matrix Oij if k= i or k= j.\nThis leads to the following rule for removing phases. Let us start by removing one\nphase, let’s take for instance ϕ12, obtaining a real V12 →O12. Then we can no longer use\nthe matrices D1 and D2 to remove phases, since we cannot commute them with O12 to the\nvery left or right of U. But, we can use for instance D3 to remove one of the remaining\nphases ϕi3, and so forth. Hence, we can remove in total n−1 phases. Starting with all\n3(s+ 1) physical angles complex, we obtain that there are 3( s+ 1) −(n−1) = 2 s+ 1\nphysical phases, i.e., 1 phase for no sterile neutrinos, 3 phases for the 3+1 spectrum, and\n5 phases for the 3+2 spectrum. Those remaining phases cannot be associated arbitrarily\nto the Vij but only in a way which is consistent with the above prescription to remove\nphases.

For example, in Sec. 5.2 of Ref. [141] it was noted that the diﬀerent chemical\ncomposition of the Earth mantle and core has very little impact on NSI results. The\nlast approximation is adopted here for purely practical reasons, since (together with the\nother two) it allows to greatly simplify the calculation of the neutrino evolution [139, 143].\nUnfortunately, in the present context the matter term ˆV(3) cannot be ﬁxed a priori, but it\narises as an eﬀective quantity determined by the angles and phases of the mixing matrix\nU.

As systematic uncertainties, we include in the analysis of the NC (CC)\nsample a 4% (10%) overall normalization uncertainty on the far-to-near ratio, separate 15%\n(20%) uncertainties in the background normalization at the far and near detectors, a 3%\n(5%) error on the energy calibration for signal events and a 1% (5%) error on the energy\ncalibration for background events. For the NC analysis, the systematic uncertainties are\nbased on the information given in [42], for the CC "}

Dark Matter in the Universe\nThere is a body of strong and convincing evidence that most of the mass in the observable\nuniverse is not composed of known particles. Indeed, numerous independent tracers of the\ngravitational potential (observations of the motion of stars in galaxies and galaxies in clusters;\nemissions from hot ionised gas in galaxy groups and clusters; 21 cm line in galaxies; both weak\nand strong gravitational lensing measurements) demonstrate that the dynamics of galaxies\nand galaxy clusters cannot be explained by the Newtonian potential created by visible matter\nonly. Moreover, cosmological data (analysis of the cosmic microwave background anisotropies\nand of the statistics of galaxy number counts) show that the cosmic large scale structure\nstarted to develop long before decoupling of photons due to the recombination of hydrogen\nin the early Universe and, therefore, long before ordinary matter could start clustering. This\nevidence points at the existence of a new substance, universally distributed in objects of all\nscales and providing a contribution to the total energy density of the Universe at the level of\nabout 27%. This hypothetical new substance is commonly known as ”Dark Matter” (DM).\nThe DM abundance is often expressed in terms of the density parameter ΩDM = ρDM/ρ0,\nwhere ρDM is the comoving DM density and ρ0 = 3H2m2\nPl/(8π) is the critical density of the\nuniverse, with H the Hubble parameter and mPl the Planck mass.

Diﬀerent\naspects of the DM problem can be found in reviews [2–4], for historical exposition of the\nproblem see [3, 5, 6]. Various attempts to explain this phenomenon by the presence of\nmacroscopic compact objects (such as, for example, old stars [7–10]) or by modiﬁcations of\nthe laws of gravity (for a review see [11–13]) failed to provide a consistent description of all\nthe above phenomena (see the overviews in [13, 14]). Therefore, a microscopic origin of DM\nphenomenon, i.e., a new particle or particles, remains the most plausible hypothesis. 1\n1.1. Standard Model Neutrino as Dark Matter Candidate?\nThe only electrically neutral and long-lived particles in the Standard Model (SM) of\nparticle physics are the neutrinos, the properties of which are brieﬂy reviewed in Sec. 2\n(cf. e.g. [16] for a review of neutrinos in cosmology). As experiments show that neutrinos\nhave mass, they could in principle play the role of DM particles. Neutrinos are involved\nin weak interactions (3) that keep them in thermal equilibrium in the early Universe down\nto the temperatures of few MeV. At smaller temperatures, the interaction rate of weak\nreactions drops below the expansion rate of the Universe and neutrinos “freeze out” from the\nequilibrium. Therefore, a background of relic neutrinos was created just before primordial\nnucleosynthesis. As interaction strength and, therefore, decoupling temperature of these\nparticles are known, one"}

Solution to Dark Matter Puzzle in Diﬀerent Approaches to BSM Physics\nThe hypothesis that DM is made of particles necessarily implies an extension of the SM\nwith new particles.

This baryon asymmetry of the universe\n(BAU) is believed to be the origin of all baryonic matter in the present day universe\nafter mutual annihilation of all other particles and antiparticles, cf. e.g. [24].\nIV) The hot big bang : Which mechanism set the homogeneous and isotropic initial\nconditions of the radiation dominated epoch in cosmic history?

Some yet unknown particles or interactions would be needed to answer these\nquestions.\nPerhaps, most of the research in BSM physics during the last decades was devoted to a\nsolution of the gauge hierarchy problem, i.e. the problem of quantum stability of the mass of\nthe Higgs boson against radiative corrections. The requirement of the absence of quadrati-\ncally divergent corrections to the Higgs boson is an example of so-called “naturalness”, cf.\neg. [25]. Quite a number of diﬀerent suggestions were proposed on how the “naturalness”\nof the electroweak symmetry breaking can be achieved. They are based on supersymmetry,\ntechnicolour, large extra dimensions or other ideas. Most of these approaches postulate the\nexistence of new particles that participate in electroweak interactions. Therefore in these\nmodels weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) appear as natural DM candidates.\nWIMPs generalise the idea of neutrino DM [26]: they also interact with the SM sector with\nroughly electroweak strength, however their mass is large (from few GeV to hundreds of\nTeV), so that these particles are already non-relativistic when they decouple from primor-\ndial plasma.

This “universal” density happens to be within the order of magnitude\nconsistent with DM density (the so-called “ WIMP miracle ”). WIMPs are usually stable or\nvery long lived, but can annihilate with each other in the regions of large DM densities,\nproducing a ﬂux of γ-rays, antimatter and neutrinos.

Heavy ”Sterile” Neutrinos\nAs we saw above, neutrinos in principle are a very natural DM candidate.

The hydro-\ngen makes ﬁlaments “visible” via absorption features in the spectra of distant quasars. The\nstatistics of these absorption features allows to reconstruct the distribution of neutral hy-\ndrogen and, under the assumption that it traces the matter distribution, the matter power\nspectrum itself [254–258]. The structure of the ﬁlaments is diﬀerent in cold- and warm\nDM cosmologies [259–261] which makes Lyman- α forest method a powerful probe of DM\nfree-streaming [53, 246, 247, 253, 262–270].\nThe basic obs"}

It\nis not possible to de-project this observable and to reconstruct the underlying matter power\nspectrum [271]. Therefore the common approach is to compare the data to the mock spectra\nextracted from hydrodynamical simulations.

The transmitted ﬂux power spectrum reaches a maximum (at k ∼\n0.02 s/km at z = 4 −6) and then decreases for larger k [273–277]. This is a qualitative\nbehaviour expected from the 1D matter power spectrum of WDM. And indeed, the work [277]\ndemonstrated that the characteristic shape of the suppression of the power spectrum and its\nevolution with redshifts can be completely explained by WDM (cf. also [278]).\nHowever, free streaming of DM particles is not the only eﬀect that can aﬀect the shape\nof ﬂux power spectrum. At redshifts of interest the IGM is in a highly ionised state, being\nphoto-ionized and photo-heated by early sources. As a result, the amount of ﬂux power\nspectrum at small scales as compared to the matter power spectrum can be reduced via\nseveral distinct astrophysical mechanisms.\nFirst of all, thermal motion of gas leads to the increase of the absorption line width.

It is, for\nexample, well known they can impact the rate of neutrinoless double β decay [153, 512–516],\nand the existence of a keV neutrino in principle allows to make predictions for this rate [517].\nHowever, since heavy neutrinos with MI < 100 MeV themselves cannot give a signiﬁcant\ncontribution to the decay [513], this impact is always indirect and therefore strongly model\ndependent, i.e., it relies on assumptions about other possible sources of LNV. The impact of\nDM sterile neutrinos on most other observables that are commonly used to indirectly test\nlow scale seesaw models (see e.g. [149, 150] and references therein) is insigniﬁcant due to the\nstrong constraints on the mixing angles θ from X-ray constraints and the requirement that\ntheir lifetime is longer than the age of the universe.\nCurrently, astrophysical bounds are some orders of magnitudes stronger than any lab-\noratory limit.

We refer to bounds as ”model independent” if they only rely on the\nassumptions that the particles in question are massive fermions that carry no charges under\nany of the gauge interactions in the SM and that they mix with the known neutrino ﬂavours\nνα. These properties can in fact be understood as the deﬁning features of a heavy sterile\nneutrino. We display the most important model dependent bounds in ﬁgure 14.

Moreover, a\nbetter understanding of baryonic eﬀects in simulations of structure formation will reduce the\nsystematic uncertainties in the translation of sterile neutrino properties into an observable\nmatter power spectrum. In addition to these indirect searches, there are several proposals\nto search for DM sterile neutrinos directly in the laboratory, which we reviewed in detail in\nsection 5.2. These involve the possibility of sterile neutrino captures by nuclei (section 5.2.1)\nas well as scatterings oﬀ nuclei (section 5.2.2), which somewhat resemble conventional direct\nsearches for WIMPs. Another possibility is to search for the impact of the sterile neutrino\nin β decay spectra. This could e.g. be done with an upgrade of the KATRIN experiment\n59"}

We display the statistical sensitivity of such a search in ﬁgure 14. For low\nmasses, it could indeed outperform the indirect searches for X-ray emission.\nIn summary, we conclude that sterile neutrinos are a theoretically very well-motivated\nDM candidate that can be searched for indirectly and directly. If the sterile neutrinos are\nsolely produced by the weak interaction, the combination of diﬀerent constrains conﬁnes the\nallowed parameter region in all directions in the M-θplane, cf. ﬁgure 14. Similar constraints\ncan be obtained for the other production mechanisms (with the exception of the lower bound\non θ, which can be avoided if the DM production does not rely on mixing). This makes sterile\nneutrinos a very testable DM candidate, and at least the minimal models can be ruled out\nor conﬁrmed within foreseeable time.\nAcknowledgements\nMaD would like to thank George Fuller, Mikko Laine, Fedor Bezrukov, Alexander Merle\nand Aurel Schneider for very valuable input during previous collaborations on which part\nof the present discussion is based.

INTRODUCTION\nFor almost two decades, the possible existence of light sterile neutrinos—new species\nof neutral fermions participating in neutrino oscillation—has intrigued the neutrino physics\ncommunity. The excitement is fuelled in particular by a number of unexpected experimental\nresults: an unexplained excess of electron anti-neutrinos (¯ νe) in a muon anti-neutrino (¯νµ)\nbeam observed at a baseline of ∼30 m from the source in the LSND experiment [1]; a similar\nexcess found by the MiniBooNE collaboration at higher energies and correspondingly larger\nbaseline [2]; the disagreement between theoretically predicted ¯νe ﬂuxes from nuclear reactors\nand observations [3, 4], known as the reactor anti-neutrino anomaly [5] (see also [6–8]); and\na similar disagreement between expectations and observations in experiments using intense\nradioactive sources [9, 10].\nThese anomalies need to be contrasted with a large set of null results in theνµ →νµ, νe →\nνe, and νµ →νe oscillation channels as well as the corresponding anti-neutrino channels. The\nobservation of all of these channels overconstrains sterile neutrino models, therefore global\nﬁts of such models exhibit pronounced tension, even though diﬀerent data sets on each\nindividual oscillation channel are consistent, for recent analyses see e.g. [11–21].\nIn this work, we update our previous analyses from refs. [11, 14, 21] to incorporate new\nexperimental results. These are in particular the following:\n1.

Unlike the results from\nprevious short-baseline reactor experiments that have led to the reactor anti-neutrino\nanomaly, these new analyses are based on a comparison of measured spectra at diﬀerent\nbaselines rather than a comparison of data to theoretically predicted spectra. The new\nresults are therefore insensitive to possible mismodelling of the ¯νe emission from nuclear\nreactors. In particular, they are insensitive to an observed, but so far unexplained,\nbump at neutrino energies ∼5 MeV [27–29] 1. Spectral distortions in the recent data\nfrom DANSS and NEOS lead to a hint in favour of sterile neutrinos at the 3 σ level,\nwhich supports the previous reactor anomaly independent of ﬂux predictions.\n2. Daya Bay measurements of the individual neutrino ﬂuxes from diﬀerent ﬁssible iso-\ntopes [37]. By combining the time evolution of the observed reactor anti-neutrino\nspectra with the known evolution of the reactor fuel composition, the Daya Bay col-\nlaboration was able to determine independently the neutrino ﬂuxes from the two most\nimportant ﬁssible isotopes in a nuclear reactor,235U and 239Pu. Their analysis suggests\nthat the discrepancy between predicted and observed ﬂuxes stems mainly from 235U,\nwhile the neutrino ﬂux from 239Pu appears consistent with predictions.

Updated reactor analysis\nThe reactor analysis includes the experiments listed in table I. The ﬁt by now is dominated\nlargely by the recent NEOS [23] and DANSS [26] results, as well as the latest data from\nDaya Bay. For the latter we include the ratios of spectra measured in experimental halls\n(EH) 3 and 1, and in experimental halls 2 and 1 [71], as well as the measurement of the\nindividual neutrino ﬂuxes from each ﬁssible isotope [37]. The analysis presented here is based\nlargely on ref. [21] where more details can be found. The important diﬀerence with respect\nto that analysis is the recent preliminary results from the DANSS experiment presented in\nDecember 2017 [26], which consists of a data sample of approximately four times increased\nexposure compared to the one shown in March 2017 [25] used in [21]. Another recent analysis\nincluding this latest DANSS data can be found in ref. [91].\nRegarding reactor neutrino ﬂux predictions we consider two scenarios: (i) ﬁxed ﬂuxes,\nwhere we set the uncertainties on the predicted anti-neutrino ﬂuxes to the values estimated\nin the original publications [3, 4]; (ii) free ﬂuxes, where the normalizations of the neutrino\nﬂuxes from the four main ﬁssible isotopes 235U, 238U, 239Pu and 241Pu are allowed to ﬂoat\nfreely. (A weak constraint ±20% at 1 σ is included for the numerically subdominant ﬂuxes\nfrom 238U and 241Pu to avoid unphysical values.)

(–)νµ DISAPPEARANCE DATA\nSearches for muon neutrino disappearance due to oscillations involving a fourth neutrino\nmass state have recently received a signiﬁcant boost thanks to novel results on sterile neu-\ntrinos from atmospheric neutrino data (both in the TeV energy window from IceCube [52]\nand at lower energy from DeepCore [49]) as well as from a combined analysis of MINOS\nand MINOS+ charged current (CC) and neutral current (NC) data [43]. Also NO νA has\npresented a ﬁrst search for sterile neutrinos based on NC data [44]. Searches for a deﬁcit of\nNC events are of particular interest because they are sensitive to mixing of sterile neutrinos\nwith any active neutrino ﬂavor. As such, any deﬁcit found would be a unique signature of\nsterile neutrinos. The new analyses by IceCube, DeepCore, MINOS/MINOS+, and NO νA\ncomplement, and signiﬁcantly extend, the exclusion regions from the short-baseline experi-\nments CDHS [101] and MiniBooNE [102, 103], from Super-Kamiokande data on atmospheric\nneutrinos [48, 104], and from MINOS [105].\nThe high-energy IceCube analysis from ref. [52] exploits the fact that active-to-sterile\nneutrino oscillations in matter are resonantly enhanced by the MSW eﬀect [55, 56] at an\nenergy of\nEres = 5.3 TeV ×\n(5 g/cm3\nρ⊕\n)(∆m2\n41\n1 eV2\n)\n.

Equation (8) implies that, for\nsterile neutrinos at the eV-scale, neutrino telescopes like IceCube can in principle observe\nmaximal oscillations at TeV energies — a sweet spot well above the detection threshold,\nbut still low enough for the atmospheric neutrino ﬂux to be appreciable [57, 58]. For larger\nor smaller ∆ m2\n41, the sensitivity is expected to dwindle as the resonance moves to energies\nwith a lower neutrino ﬂux, or moves below the energy threshold of the detector. A limiting\nfactor to this analysis is the fact that, for ∆ m2\n41 >0 as considered here, the resonance is in\nthe anti-neutrino sector. Since neutrino telescopes cannot distinguish neutrinos from anti-\nneutrinos on an event-by-event basis, and since anti-neutrino cross sections are smaller by\nabout a factor of three than neutrino cross sections, the magnitude of the observable eﬀect\nis reduced.3 Moreover, for small mixing angles, the resonance width,\n∆Eres ∼∆m2\n41 sin2 2θ24\n2VMSW\n, (9)\nis small, so that only a very small fraction of the energy spectrum is aﬀected.

CONSTRAINTS ON |Uτ4|\nMixing between tau neutrinos and possible sterile states is particularly diﬃcult to con-\nstrain since no ντ sources are available. Nevertheless, constraints can be obtained in the\nfollowing two ways: (i) studying matter eﬀects. All active neutrino ﬂavors experience an\nMSW potential caused by coherent forward scattering throughZboson exchange, while ster-\nile neutrinos do not. This inﬂuences νe disappearance observed in solar neutrino experiments,\nas well as νµ disappearance observed in beam experiments and in atmospheric neutrinos.\nThe latter yield particularly strong limits as they possess the longest baselines in matter.\n(ii) exploiting neutral current events, which are sensitive to any disappearance of active\nneutrinos. This approach allows us to derive constraints from the sterile neutrino searches\nin MINOS/MINOS+ [43] and NO νA [44], and from SNO solar neutrino data [79–81]. The\ncorresponding analysis codes used in our ﬁt are the same as discussed in sections III and V.\nCompared to ref. [14], we have in particular added IceCube, DeepCore, MINOS/MINOS+,\nand NOνA data to the ﬁt.\nOur results are shown in the four panels of ﬁg. 6. Each panel corresponds to a diﬀerent\nﬁxed value of ∆ m2\n41, and the corresponding contours have been drawn based on the χ2\ndiﬀerences relative to the best ﬁt point for this ﬁxed ∆ m2\n41.

We see that depending on ∆m2\n41, the limit on |Uµ4|\nis driven by MINOS/MINOS+, IceCube, or the short-baseline experiments MiniBooNE and\nCDHS, in agreement with ﬁg. 5. The strongest constraints on |Uτ4|typically come from\natmospheric neutrinos. We ﬁnd that the combined bound is independent of ∆ m2\n41 and is\ngiven by\n|Uτ4|2 <0.13 (0.17) at 90% (99%) CL .

We stress that we are not aware of any strong reason to discard data\nfrom particular experiments. The sole purpose of this exercise is to demonstrate the impact\nof individual data sets and establish the robustness of our conclusion.\nThe ﬁrst row in table VII corresponds to the global analysis using free reactor ﬂuxes and\nLSND DaR+DiF data, which is the combination of data we use throughout this table. The\nremaining part of the table shows that very strong tension remains even after removing any\nindividual experiment. In particular, the PG remains below ≈5 ×10−6 when any of the (–)νµ\ndisappearance data sets are removed, so it does not rely on the particular treatment of any\nof those experiments. Even when all reactor data are removed, the PG remains very small\n(3.8 ×10−5).\nThe only signiﬁcant improvement is obtained when removing LSND. The still somewhat\nlow PG of 0 .16% is a manifestation of the tension between the MiniBooNE excess and the\ndisappearance data. But it is clear that the very strong appearance/disappearance tension\nis driven by LSND. Note also that this remains true when MiniBooNE is removed, and\ntherefore the result does not depend on the low-energy excess in MiniBooNE.\nThe only way to reconcile LSND would be to discard (–)νµ disappearance data altogether.\nNote that even if we remove all (–)νe disappearance data, the PG remains low, at 2 .4 ×\n10−4.

Remarkably, just using (–)νµ disappearance\nplus solar neutrinos pushes the PG already to 7 .4 ×10−6. This demonstrates once again\nthat our conclusion is independent of reactor neutrino data.\nWe observe from table VII that the PG gets nearly an order of magnitude worse when\nremoving the gallium data. The reason is the slight tension between gallium and reactor data\ndiscussed in section III B. If gallium is removed, the (–)νe disappearance ﬁt alone improves,\nand therefore the tension with appearance data increases.\nFinally, we have also performed a slightly diﬀerent PG test, by dividing the data into\nνµ disappearance versus the combined νe appearance and νe disappearance data. This\ncorresponds to the samples compared in ﬁg. 5. Using LSND DaR+DiF data and free reactor\nﬂuxes we obtain a χ2\nPG = 23.4. According to table V, the common parameters in those two\ndata sets are ∆m2\n31,∆m2\n41,θ14,θ24,θ34. Therefore, χ2\nPG has to be evaluated for 5 dof, leading\nto a p-value of 2.8 ×10−4.\nVIII. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS\nWe have presented an updated global analysis of neutrino oscillation data within a 3 + 1\nsterile neutrino mass scheme. We have obtained two main results, which can be summarized\nas follows:\n1. Reactor neutrino data show a ≳ 3σ preference for sterile neutrino oscillations with\n∆m2\n41 ≈1.3 eV 2 and |Ue4|≈ 0.1.

This leads to very strong tension between the\nanomalies in the appearance sector (LSND and MiniBooNE) and disappearance data.\nWe ﬁnd that appearance and disappearance data are incompatible, with a parameter\ngoodness-of-ﬁt test yielding a p-value of less than 2.6 ×10−6. This result does not rely\non any single experiment in the (–)νµ sector and is robust with respect to theoretical\npredictions of reactor ﬂuxes; the p-value remains at 3.8 ×10−5 even if all reactor data\nare removed. The tension is dominated by LSND; the MiniBooNE anomaly plays a\nsubleading role.\nOur results rule out the sterile neutrino oscillation hypothesis as an explanation of the\nLSND and MiniBooNE anomalies, but it remains a viable option for the reactor and gallium\nanomalies.\nSome comments are in order. Our conclusion in item 1 above is largely based on prelimi-\nnary data from DANSS presented at conferences [25, 26]. Our results are in agreement with\nanother recent analysis done outside the DANSS collaboration [91]. However, those results\nwill need to be supported by an oﬃcial publication by the collaboration.\nThroughout this work we have restricted ourselves to the 3 + 1 scenario, adding just one\nmass state at the eV scale. However, we expect that the tension between appearance and\ndisappearance data cannot be resolved by adding more sterile neutrinos.

The reason is that the quadratic suppression of\nthe νµ →νe oscillation amplitudes by constraints on the elements |Uei|and |Uµi|(i ≥4)\nfrom disappearance data remains equally true in scenarios with more than one eV-scale mass\nstates. Therefore we expect that our conclusion concerning the sterile neutrino explanation\nof appearance anomalies remains qualitatively true also for more sterile neutrinos.\nFinally, we remind the reader that a completely orthogonal set of constraints on eV-\nscale sterile neutrinos comes from cosmology. The standard picture is that active neutrinos\nevolve into a superposition of active and sterile states at temperatures ≳ MeV. Hard,\nﬂavour-sensitive collisions mediated by W and Z bosons collapse these superpositions into\npurely active or purely sterile states, with the relative probability given by the active–\nsterile mixing angles. After a large number of collisions, active and sterile neutrinos come\ninto thermal equilibrium. Because of this, the vanilla 3 + 1 model appears to be strongly\ndisfavoured by constraints on the number of relativistic species Neﬀ at the time of Big\nBang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) [112] and during the recombination epoch [113]. Moreover,\nconstraints on the sum of neutrino masses, ∑mν from Cosmic Microwave Background\nand structure formation data disfavour extra neutrino species with masses ≳ 0.3 eV [113].\nHowever, these constraints are model-dependent, and in non-minimal scenarios they can be\nweakened or a"}

INTRODUCTION\nThe evidence that dark matter is required to make sense of our Universe has been building\nfor some time. In 1933 Fritz Zwicky found that the velocity dispersion of galaxies in the\nComa cluster of galaxies was far too large to be supported by the luminous matter (1).\nIn the 1970s, Vera Rubin and collaborators (2; 3) and Albert Bosma (4) measured the\nrotation curves of individual galaxies and also found evidence for non-luminous matter.\nThis and other “classic” evidence for non-luminous matter (see, e.g., Ref. (5)) has now\nbeen supplemented by data from weak (6) and strong (7) lensing, hot gas in clusters (8),\nthe Bullet Cluster (9), Big Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) (10), further constraints from large\nscale structure (11), distant supernovae (12; 13), and the cosmic microwave background\n(CMB) (14).\nTogether, these data now provide overwhelming evidence for the remarkable fact that not\nonly is there non-luminous matter in our Universe, but most of it is not composed of baryons\nor any of the other known particles. Current data imply that dark matter is ﬁve times more\nprevalent than normal matter and accounts for about a quarter of the Universe. More\nprecisely, these data constrain the energy densities of the Universe in baryons, non-baryonic\ndark matter (DM), and dark energy Λ to be (14)\nΩB ≃0.0456 ±0.0016 (1)\nΩDM ≃0.227 ±0.014 (2)\nΩΛ ≃0.728 ±0.015 .

They may be divided into three categories:\n•Spin 1/2 Fermions. These matter particles include six ﬂavors of quarks (up, down,\ncharm, strange, bottom, and top), three ﬂavors of charged leptons (electrons, muons,\nand taus), and three ﬂavors of neutral leptons (the electron, muon, and tau neutrinos).\nThese are grouped into three generations, as indicated in Fig. 1.\n•Spin 1 Gauge Bosons.

Most of the matter particles\nare unstable, with lifetimes far shorter than the age of the Universe. The remaining particles\nare the six lightest: the electron, the up and down quarks, which may form stable protons\nand neutrons in nuclei, and the three neutrinos. Electrons may contribute signiﬁcantly to\ndark matter only if they are neutralized through binding with protons, but protons (and\nneutrons) contribute to the baryonic energy density ΩB, which is too small to be all of dark\nmatter. In addition, current upper bounds on neutrino masses from particle physics and\ncosmology imply that the neutrino relic density Ω ν ≃∑\nimνi/47 eV <∼0.012 (14). The\nevidence for dark matter therefore requires particles beyond the SM.\nB. Problems\nIn addition to the need for dark matter, other problems motivate physics beyond the SM.\nThese problems are of two types.

In the SM, electroweak symmetry is broken, and the Higgs boson mass is\nnon-zero. The gauge hierarchy problem is the question of why mh ∼100 GeV ≪MPl.\nThis problem is exacerbated in the SM by quantum corrections.

The parameter λis an O(1) dimensionless coupling, and\nΛ is the energy scale at which the SM is no longer a valid description of nature. Because\n∆m2\nh is proportional to Λ 2, it is natural to expect the Higgs mass to be pulled up to within\nan order of magnitude of Λ by quantum corrections.

Such parti-\ncles typically create many new problems, however, because they may violate baryon number,\nlepton number, ﬂavor, or CP, where C and P are the discrete transformations of charge\nconjugation and parity, respectively. These symmetries are either beautifully preserved or\nviolated only slightly in the SM, but there is no guarantee that new mweak particles will\npreserve them. This set of problems is collectively known as the new physics ﬂavor problem.\nThe new physics ﬂavor problem implies that not all solutions to the gauge hierarchy\nproblem are equally elegant.

Thermal Freeze Out\n1. THE WIMP MIRACLE\nIf a WIMP exists and is stable, it is naturally produced with a relic density consistent with\nthat required of dark matter. This tantalizing fact, sometimes referred to as the “WIMP\nmiracle,” implies that particles that are motivated by the gauge hierarchy problem, a purely\nmicrophysical puzzle, are excellent dark matter candidates.\nDark matter may be produced in a simple and predictive manner as a thermal relic of\nthe Big Bang (25; 26; 27; 28). The evolution of a thermal relic’s number density is shown\nin Fig. 2. Initially the early Universe is dense and hot, and all particles are in thermal\nequilibrium. The Universe then cools to temperatures T below the dark matter particle’s\nmass mX, and the number of dark matter particles becomes Boltzmann suppressed, dropping\nexponentially as e−mX/T. The number of dark matter particles would drop to zero, except\nthat, in addition to cooling, the Universe is also expanding. In stage (3), the Universe\nbecomes so large and the gas of dark matter particles becomes so dilute that they cannot\nﬁnd each other to annihilate. The dark matter particles then “freeze out,” with their number\nasymptotically approaching a constant, their thermal relic density. Note that freeze out,\nalso known as chemical decoupling, is distinct from kinetic decoupling; after thermal freeze\nout, interactions that change the number of dark matter particles become negligible, but\ninteractions that mediate energy exchange between dark matter and other particles may\nremain eﬃcient.\nThis process is describe"}

This is the cosmological legacy of LEP, the Large\nElectron-Positron Collider that ran from 1989-2000. Generically, new particles introduced\nto solve the gauge hierarchy problem would be expected to induce new interactions\nSM SM →NP →SM SM , (9)\nwhere SM and NP denote standard model and new particles, respectively. If the new particles\nare heavy, they cannot be produced directly, but their eﬀects may nevertheless be seen\nas perturbations on the properties of SM particles. LEP, along with the Stanford Linear\nCollider, looked for the eﬀects of these interactions and found none, constraining the mass\nscale of new particles to be above ∼1−10 TeV, depending on the SM particles involved (see,\ne.g., Ref. (30)). At the same time, to solve the gauge hierarchy problem, the new particles\ncannot be decoupled completely.

Direct Detection\nAs discussed in Sec. III.A.3, WIMP dark matter may be detected by its scattering\noﬀ normal matter through processes X SM →X SM. Given a typical WIMP mass of\nmX ∼ 100 GeV and WIMP velocity v ∼ 10−3, the deposited recoil energy is at most\n∼100 keV, requiring highly sensitive, low background detectors placed deep underground.\nSuch detectors are insensitive to very strongly interacting dark matter, which would be\nstopped in the atmosphere or earth and would be undetectable underground. However, such\ndark matter would be seen by rocket and other space-borne experiments or would settle to\nthe core of the Earth, leading to other fascinating and bizarre implications. Taken together,\na diverse quilt of constraints now excludes large scattering cross sections for a wide range\nof dark matter masses (54; 55), and we may concentrate on the weak cross section frontier\nprobed by underground detectors.\nThe ﬁeld of direct detection is extremely active, with sensitivities increasing by two orders\nof magnitude in the last deca"}

The observation of missing particles only implies\nthat a particle was produced that was stable enough to exit the detector, typically implying\na lifetime τ >∼10−7 s, a far cry from the criterion τ >∼1017 s required for dark matter.\nClearly more is needed. In the last few years, there has been a great deal of progress in\nthis direction. The main point of this progress has been to show that colliders can perform\ndetailed studies of new physics, and this can constrain the dark matter candidate’s properties\nso strongly that the candidate’s thermal relic density can be precisely determined. The\nconsistency of this density with the cosmologically observed density would then be strong\nevidence that the particle produced at colliders is, in fact, the cosmological dark matter.\nThis approach is analogous to the well-known case of BBN.

SUPERWIMPS\nThe WIMP miracle might appear to require that dark matter have weak interactions\nif its relic density is naturally to be in the right range. This is not true, however — in\nrecent years, two other mechanisms have been shown to be viable and lead to dark matter\nparticles that also exploit the WIMP miracle to have the correct relic density, but have\nvastly diﬀerent interactions and implications for detection. These two possibilities are the\ntopics of this section and Sec. VI.\nIn this section, we discuss superWIMPs, superweakly-interacting massive particles, which\nhave the desired relic density, but have interactions that are much weaker than weak. The\nextremely weak interactions of SuperWIMPs might naively be thought to be a nightmare for\nsearches for dark matter. In fact, superWIMP scenarios predict signals from cosmic rays, at\ncolliders, and in astrophysics that can be far more striking than in WIMP scenarios, making\nsuperWIMPs highly amenable to experimental investigation.\nA. Production Mechanisms\n1. DECAYS\nIn the superWIMP framework, dark matter is produced in late decays: WIMPs freeze out\nas usual in the early Universe, but later decay to superWIMPs, which form the dark matter\nthat exists today (125; 126). Because superWIMPs are very weakly interacting, they have\nno impact on WIMP freeze out in the early Universe, and the WIMPs decouple, as usual,\nwith a thermal relic density ΩWIMP ∼ΩDM.

Assuming that each WIMP decay produces one\nsuperWIMP, the relic density of superWIMPs is\nΩSWIMP = mSWIMP\nmWIMP\nΩWIMP . (17)\nSuperWIMPs therefore inherit their relic density from WIMPs, and for mSWIMP ∼mWIMP,\nthe WIMP miracle also implies that superWIMPs are produced in the desired amount to\nbe much or all of dark matter. The evolution of number densities is shown in Fig. 12.\nThe WIMP decay may be very late by particle physics standards. For example, if the\nsuperWIMP interacts only gravitationally, as is true of many well-known candidates, the\nnatural timescale for WIMPs decaying to superWIMP is 1 /(GNm3\nweak) ∼103 −107 s.\nBecause the WIMP is unstable and not the dark matter, it need not be neutral in this\ncontext — to preserve the naturalness of the superWIMP relic density, all that is required is\nΩWIMP ∼ΩDM. In the case of supersymmetry, for example, the WIMP may be a neutralino,\nbut it may also be a charged slepton. Even though charged sleptons interact with photons,\non dimensional grounds, their annihilation cross sections are also necessarily governed by\nthe weak scale, and so are ∼ g4\nweak/m2\nweak, implying roughly the same relic densities as\ntheir neutral counterparts. Of course, whether the WIMP is charged or not determines the\nproperties of the other particles produced in WIMP decay, which has strong consequences\nfor observations, as we will see below.\n2.

The energy release is conveniently expressed\nin terms of\nζEM ≡ϵEMYNLSP (25)\nfor electromagnetic energy, with a similar expression for hadronic energy. Here ϵEM is the\ninitial EM energy released in NLSP decay and YNLSP ≡nNLSP/nγ is the NLSP number\ndensity just before it decays, normalized to the background photon number density nγ =\n2ζ(3)T3/π2. Once the NLSP is speciﬁed, and assuming superWIMPs from late decays make\nup all of the dark matter, with Ω ˜G = ΩDM = 0.23, both the lifetime and energy release are\ndetermined by only two parameters: m˜G and mNLSP.

BIG BANG NUCLEOSYNTHESIS\nLate time energy release after t∼1 s also destroys and creates light elements, potentially\ndistorting the predictions of standard BBN. The impact depends sensitively on what the de-\ncaying NLSP is. For example, in the neutralino NLSP case, the neutralino decays generically\nthrough χ→Z˜G,h ˜G,γ ˜G. The ﬁrst two modes lead to hadrons, which are very dangerous.\nConstraints from BBN on hadronic energy release essentially exclude the neutralino WIMP\nscenario, allowing only the ﬁne-tuned case in which the neutralino is photino-like, χ ≈˜γ,\nin which case the decays to Z˜G and h˜G are suppressed (160; 161). In the charged slepton\nNLSP case, the decaying WIMP may ﬁrst bind with nuclei, which may enhance the eﬀect\nof its decays on BBN (162; 163; 164; 165; 166).\nBBN constraints on the gravitino superWIMP possibility have been considered in a num-\nber of studies.

Models with large lifetimes and\nlight staus are the most promising for the collider studies described in Sec.

The thermal relic density therefore constrains the rates of indirect detec-\ntion signals. In the WIMPless case, however, this connection is weakened, since the thermal\nrelic density is governed by hidden sector annihilation and gauge interactions, while the\nindirect detection signals are governed by the interactions of Eq.

For production by oscillations, current bounds require ms >∼10 keV,\neﬀectively excluding this production mechanism as a source for all of dark matter (see\nFig. 20). For colder production mechanisms, however, the Lyman- α bounds on ms are\nweaker, and these mechanisms may viably produce all of the dark matter. We see, though,\nthat for much of sterile neutrino parameter space, power on small scales is reduced, providing\nan observable diﬀerence from vanilla cold dark matter. For further discussion of small scale\nstructure constraints on sterile neutrinos, see Ref. (180; 229; 237; 242).\nIn addition to its impact on small structure and the X-ray spectrum, sterile neutrinos\nmay have other astrophysical eﬀects, for example, on the velocity distribution of pulsars and\non the formation of the ﬁrst stars.

In addition, Eq.

As the Universe cools to a temperature T ∼fa, the\naxion ﬁeld takes values that vary from place to place. This is known as the Peccei-Quinn\n(PQ) phase transition. Although the value of the axion ﬁeld now is ﬁxed to minimize the\nvacuum energy and solve the strong CP problem, at temperatures T >∼GeV, other eﬀects\ndominate the vacuum energy, and all values of the axion ﬁeld are equally possible.\nIf inﬂation occurs after the PQ phase transition, then our observable Universe lies in a\npatch with a single value of the axion ﬁeld.

CONCLUSIONS\nCurrent observations support a remarkably simple model of the Universe consisting of\nbaryons, dark matter, and dark energy, supplemented by initial conditions determined by\nan early epoch of inﬂation. If scientiﬁc progress is characterized by periods of confusion,\nwhich are resolved by neat and tidy models, which are then launched back into confusion\nby further data, the current era is most deﬁnitely of the neat and tidy sort.\nDark matter may be the area that launches us back into confusion with further data.\nThe microscopic properties of dark matter are as much of a mystery now as they were in\nthe 1930’s. In the next few years, however, searches for dark matter through a variety of\nmeans discussed here will discover or exclude many of the most promising candidates.\nAt its core, the dark matter problem is highly interdisciplinary. Rather than attempt a\nsummary of this review, we close with some optimistic, but plausible, scenarios for the future\nin which experiments from both particle physics and astrophysics are required to identify\ndark matter. Consider the following examples:\n•Scenario 1: Direct detection experiments see a dark matter signal in spin-independent\nscattering. This result is conﬁrmed by the LHC, which sees a missing energy signal\nthat is followed up by precision measurements pointing to a 800 GeV Kaluza-Klein\ngauge boson.

Toward this goal,\nwe discuss the L2 sensitivity, a convenient statistical indicator for exploring the statistical pulls of\nindividual data sets on the best-fit PDFs and identifying tensions between competing data sets.\nUnlike the Lagrange Multiplier method, the L2 sensitivity can be quickly computed for a range\nof PDFs and momentum fractions using the published Hessian error sets. We employ the L2\nsensitivity as a common metric to study the relative importance of data sets in the recent ATLAS,\nCTEQ-TEA, MSHT, and reduced PDF4LHC21 PDF analyses at NNLO and approximate N3LO.\nWe illustrate how this method can aid the users of PDFs to identify data sets that are important for\na PDF at a given kinematic point, to study quark flavor composition and other detailed features\nof the PDFs, and to compare the data pulls on the PDFs for various perturbative orders and\nfunctional forms. We also address the feasibility of computing the sensitivities using Monte Carlo\nerror PDFs. Together with the article, we present a companion interactive website with a large\ncollection of plotted L2 sensitivities for eight recent PDF releases and a C++ program to plot the\nL2 sensitivities.\n∗ Corresponding author: nadolsky@smu.edu\n1\narXiv:2306.03918v2 [hep-ph] 2 Aug 2023"}

INTRODUCTION\nParton distribution functions (PDFs) used for predictions at the Large Hadron Collider\n(LHC) and elsewhere are determined by multivariate fits to a selection of precise experimen-\ntal measurements from deeply inelastic scattering, vector boson, jet, top-quark production,\nand other processes, including data from the LHC. The number of experimental data sets\nincluded in the recent PDF fits ranges from a few most precise ones to several tens in the\nmost comprehensive global fits. The contemporary next-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO)\nPDF fits may either use the Hessian method [1, 2] or the Monte Carlo method [3] to both\ndetermine the central PDF and estimate the uncertainty on the PDF parameters. For data\nfrom an experimental measurement to influence the PDF fit in a particular region of x\nand Q2, two conditions usually must be met: ( i) the parton-level dynamics underlying the\nmeasurement must substantially depend on a particular PDF ( e.g., that of the gluon), as\nmanifest via a statistical correlation between the PDF in that kinematic region and the\nexperimental observable [4]; and ( ii) the measurement must have sufficient resolving power\nto nontrivially contribute to the likelihood function of a QCD analysis. The latter depends\non the experimental errors of the data set, both statistical and systematic.\nIn general, all experimental data sets included in a PDF fit have some influence on the\ndetermination of a given PDF flavor for a givenx, Q2, with the amount of influence typically\nvarying over a wide range.

As an example from the first category,\nFig. 3 shows the L2 sensitivities to the gluon distribution g(x, Q) for CT18 NNLO, as\na function of the partonic momentum fraction x at a Q value of 100 GeV. Only the L2\nsensitivities from the six most significant experiments are plotted, for purposes of clarity. 1\nOne way to understand more intuitively the meaning of the L2 sensitivity is to compare\nit to the more familiar LM scans, either the already discussed case of the LM scan on the\nhigh-x gluon, g(0.3, 125 GeV), in Fig. 1 or an analogous scan on g(0.01, 125 GeV) as relevant\nfor gg → Higgs production, shown in Fig. 4. In a LM scan, the strength of the constraint\nprovided by a data set determines the narrowness of its corresponding χ2\nE parabola. For\nexample, in Fig. 4, the CMS experiment on jet production at 8 TeV (curve 11) imposes such\na constraint, similar in magnitude to that provided by the HERA I+II data. The central\ngluon at this x agrees with the value preferred by the CMS 8 TeV jet data, so there is no\npull from these data. In contrast, the LM scan at x = 0.3, in Fig. 1, indicates that the CMS\n8 TeV jet data prefers a gluon value of 0.33, larger than the best-fit value of 0.31. These\nfeatures of the CMS 8 TeV jet "}

These\nfeatures of the CMS 8 TeV jet data at x = 0.01 and x = 0.3 can be seen in the L2 sensitivity\nplot of Fig. 3, as explained below 2.\nAt either x value, a number of experiments prefer somewhat different values of the gluon\nthan at the best fit. We can quantify these pulls on the gluon by computing the change,\n∆χ2\nE, for each experiment E when the considered PDF increases by one standard deviation\nfrom the total χ2\n0, which in the following comparisons was chosen to correspond to ∆χ2 = 10.\nWe note that ∆χ2\nE were defined above Eq. (10) in Sec. II C. TheL2 sensitivity Sf,L2 estimates\nthese ∆χ2\nE in the linear approximation for the whole range of x. The magnitude of Sf,L2\ndepends on the correlation of the χ2\nE with a particular PDF, the constraining power of the\ndata on that PDF, and the difference between the PDF preferred by that data set and the\nPDF determined by the full fit. A positive value of Sf,L2 indicates the preference for\na lower value of the PDF at the specified x and Q, and vice versa.\nFrom Fig. 3, we conclude following this rule that the HERA I+II deep inelastic scattering\n(DIS) data (ID=160) has the largest sensitivity at x <0.01, preferring a lower gluon here\nthan the CDF and CMS jet data sets (504, 542, 545).

When there is no strong prior prefer-\nence for either T1 or T2, but the data D strongly favor one of them, the ratio of posterior\nprobabilities is dominated by the ratio of the likelihoods that is related to the difference of\nχ2 for T1 and T2: \u0012P(T2)\nP(T1)\n\u0013\nposterior\n= P(D|T2)\nP(D|T1)\n\u0012P(T2)\nP(T1)\n\u0013\nprior\n, (13)\nwhere\nP(D|T2)\nP(D|T1) = exp\n\u0012\n−χ2(D, T2) − χ2(D, T1)\n2\n\u0013\n.

Summary of ATLAS fits\nATLAS PDF fits concentrate on the impact of ATLAS data on PDFs. However, it is\nnot possible to make an accurate PDF fit to ATLAS data alone. The HERA DIS combined\ndata [35] are used as the backbone of the ATLAS PDF fits, to which ATLAS data are\nadded.

[18].\nThe strategy of the CT18 analysis was to first examine a large group of data sets using\npreliminary fits and fast Hessian techniques in order to select an ensemble of constraining\nand maximally consistent data sets. The LM scans and L2 sensitivities were extensively\nemployed to identify such data sets, as documented in Ref. [17] and on the CT18 website\n[63].

Here and in the following, the lowercase “ t” indicates that the displacements of\nthe eigenvector sets from the best-fit set were computed using the idealized Gaussian χ2\narising in the diagonalization of the Hessian matrix. The uppercase “ T” indicates that the\ndisplacements are computed using the actual χ2, which includes some non-quadratic terms\nand is mildly asymmetric. The T and t criteria are generally close but not identical.\nThe MSHT20 fits by default apply the “dynamic tolerance” procedure, based on a weaker\nhypothesis-testing criterion and described in more detail in [8, 21, 144]. This enlarges the\nuncertainties beyond the ∆ χ2 = 1 definition to account for data set tensions, as well as\npotential mismatch of data and theory due to imprecision in the the"}

SENSITIVITIES FOR NON-GLOBAL FITS\nWith the background given in the previous sections, we can now analyze the Hessian\nsensitivities of the selected PDF ensembles and even compare L2 sensitivity patterns ob-\ntained with ensembles from various groups. In this section, the sensitivities will highlight\nthe prominent features of the fits that are based on specific data sets, like the ATLASpdf21\nfit [20] that is dedicated to HERA+ATLAS data, Sec. IV A. Another class of fits that we\nconsider here is the so-called reduced fits, Sec. IV B. Examples of such fits were proposed in\nthe context of the PDF4LHC21 benchmarking exercise [18, 154].\nThe full collection of the figures is available at the companion website [30], showing L2\nsensitivities to PDFs and PDF combinations and for individual fitted experiments.\nA. Sensitivities for ATLAS fits\nWe begin by comparing the χ2\nE values and the L2 sensitivity variable for the three classes\nof data, HERA, ATLAS W, Z 7 TeV and ATLAS t¯t 8 TeV, within the three fits (HER-\nAPDF2.0NNLO, ATLASepWZ16 and "}

Inclusion of additional data\nsets may also degrade the description of data already in the fit, revealing tensions among\nthe data sets.\nThe χ2\nE value of the HERA data (160) within the HERAPDF2.0NNLO fit is higher than\nideal, but similar in value to that in the CT18 and MSHT20 fits. However, it is significantly\nreduced in the ATLASepWZ16 and ATLASepWZtop18 fits because of the harder Q2 cuts\nimposed on these HERA data: Q2 > 7.5 GeV2 for the ATLASepWZ16 PDFs and Q2 >\n10 GeV2 for the ATLASepWZtop18 PDF.

SENSITIVITIES FOR CT18, CT18AS, AND CT18AS LAT FITS\nAs we summarized in Sec. III A 2, the comprehensive CT18 NNLO study [17], published\nby the CTEQ-TEA collaboration in early 2021, has extensively employed theL2 sensitivities\nin the pre-fit and post-fit investigations of the constraints from the experiments. The CT18\nwebsite [63] collects 340 plots of L2 sensitivities for the individual experiments, PDF flavors,\nPDF combinations, and parton luminosities at the LHC in the CT18 and C18Z NNLO\nanalyses. Many of these results are discussed in the CT18 publication. Complementary\ninsights were gained from visualizations of L1 sensitivities of individual data points using\nthe PDFSense program [5] and the CT14HERA2 NNLO ensemble (the immediate predecessor\nof CT18), with the resulting figures collected online at [163]. The PDFSense results were\nespecially helpful for charting the global map of sensitivities of the fitted experiments to the\nPDF flavors [5] and to PDF combinations and Mellin moments that can be computed on\nthe lattice [6].\nThis article and its companion website [30] reproduce many Sf,L2 plots from the CT18\nNNLO analysis [17, 63] in the format that facilitates the comparisons against the other PDF\nensembles.

These figures are\ndiscussed later in their respective sections.\nIn addition to the experiment-by-experiment plots of L2 sensitivities, we provide cumu-\nlative figures of sensitivities of the leading experiments to specific PDF flavors or PDF\ncombinations, such as the valence PDFs qV (x, Q) ≡ q(x, Q) − ¯q(x, Q) and PDF ratios\nfa(x, Q)/fb(x, Q).

We expect, and\nthe sensitivities reflect it, that the primary differences between CT18 and CT18As Lat arise\nin the (anti)quark flavor separation. The CT18A PDF ensemble is identical to CT18 but\nincludes ATLAS 7 TeV W, Z precision data which show sizable tension with other data sets,\nsuch as the HERA I+II DIS combined data and NuTeV dimuon data [17].

This choice slightly reduces the\nabove-mentioned tension [22]: the s(¯s) PDF error band becomes larger in comparison with\nthe analogous CT18A PDFs.

SENSITIVITIES FOR THE MSHT20 FITS\nIn this section, we present some results comparing the L2 sensitivities for the MSHT20\nNNLO and aN3LO PDFs, showing the improvements that are obtained in some cases at\naN3LO. First, in Fig.17 we compare the sensitivities for the gluon. At NNLO we see this is\ndominated by the ATLAS Z pT data, which are also comparatively poorly fit according to\nthe χ2 value presented in [21]. A similar pattern in the shape of the sensitivities is observed\nat aN3LO, although their amplitudes are substantially reduced, typically being less than\na half of that at NNLO. It is also observed in [23] that it has a substantially reduced χ2,\ncorresponding to a better fit quality at aN3LO. At NNLO, there are large corrections for\nthese precise ATLAS Z pT data so significant changes at aN3LO may well be expected.\nThe sensitivity to the HERA combined structure function data at NNLO is also very much\nreduced at aN3LO, with this set no longer in the top six data sets shown in Fig. 17. Tensions\nbetween these two data sets at NNLO are largely eliminated at aN3LO. At the PDF level,\nthe better agreement between the two experiments is accompanied by some rearrangement of\nthe gluon and quark PDFs at aN3LO in the relevantx region of about 0.01. The sensitivities\nof the CMS 8 TeV jet data and NMC Fd\n2 data do not change much and are even enhanced\nslightly when going to aN3LO (note the different axes scales), showing that inclusion of\nthe approximate N3LO corrections do not help with the tensions for these sets.

Beyond this, there are similar behaviors at NNLO and aN3LO for the HERA\ncombined structure function data and the BCDMS Fp\n2 data, which are two of the most\nsensitive sets. This is because the aN3LO fit has smaller impact at high x with respect to\nthe NNLO fit and does not significantly alter the details of flavor decomposition. Overall\nthe uV quark is well-constrained, with no very large tensions between data sets. Indeed, all\nsensitivities across the whole range of x are ≲ 5 units. The degree of tension is not obviously\nfurther reduced at aN3LO.\nFinally, in Fig. 20 we compare the results for the ¯d/¯u antiquark ratio. Here we might\nexpect little impact from aN3LO corrections. Indeed this is largely the case. In both cases\nthe E866 Drell-Yan ratio data and the ATLAS 8 TeVW data provide constraints at primarily\nlarge and small x, respectively. The former favors a reduced ¯d/¯u at large x (i.e., a larger\nasymmetry with ¯d < ¯u at large x), while the latter favors an enhanced ¯d/¯u at small x.\nThis differs slightly from the observations made for CT18 in Fig. 16 where it was observed\nthat the E866 Drell-Yan ratio data had sensitivity of -9 units (positive pull on the isospin\nasymmetry ratio) in the region 0 .04 < x <0.2.

In this paper, this was examined in the context of\ncomparing CT18, CT18As, and CT18As Lat NNLO PDFs (with the latter one including in-\ndependent parametrizations of strange quark and antiquark PDFs together with the lattice\nQCD prediction for the large-x strangeness asymmetry), as well as the MSHT20 NNLO and\naN3LO PDFs. One interesting result is the examination of pulls on strangeness and other\nsea PDFs in the various fits using the same L2 metric. Another is the evidence of reduced\ntensions in the MSHT aN3LO PDFs, compared to the corresponding NNLO ones; this is\nmost clearly seen in the strong decrease of the value of Sf,L2 for the gluon distribution for\nthe ATLAS Z pT distribution from NNLO to aN3LO, perhaps indicating a release of tension\nby transitioning to the (approximate) higher order in the PDF fit.\nTo conclude, the L2 sensitivities offer any user of Hessian PDFs valuable insights using\nthe tools outside of the PDF fit. Additional comparisons are provided on the website [30]\nand in the Supplemental material.

II B that the L2 sensitivity can also be\ndefined in the MC method, while its calculation in this method requires reducing the impact\nof non-linearities.\nIf X(⃗R) is a non-linear function of the PDF parameters ⃗R, the cumulative probability\nP(X(⃗R)) is generally not the same as P(⃗R), implying that the PDF parameters at a certain\nconfidence level for ⃗R correspond to a different confidence level for X(⃗R) [24]. As a flip\nside, a linear function X(⃗R) of the normally distributed ⃗R is also normally distributed.\nConsequently, the error PDFs work the best when the variations of X(⃗R) from the best-\nfit value X0 are approximately linear. An MC replica ensemble that is generated from a\nHessian eigenvector ensemble by following one of the available methods [24, 26] then closely\nreproduces the Hessian PDF uncertainty and correlations.\nIn some situations the normally sampled MC replicas lead to unphysical results, for\nexample, by predicting negative cross sections with a non-zero probability at large Bjorken\nx.

For these replicas, the\nχ2\nE(f(k)) functions are large and non-linear. To demonstrate the equivalence of the Hessian\nand MC sensitivities, one must resort to an alternative method that stays close enough to\nthe global minimum to suppress the quadratic component.\nWhen we use the normal sampling, we consider Nrep sets of the PDF vectors ⃗R(k) ≡\n{R(k)\n1 , ..., R(k)\nD } that are randomly sampled from theD-dimensional standard normal distribu-\ntion ND(0, 1) associated with the probability density P(⃗R) = (2π)−D/2 exp\n\u0010\n−1\n2\nPD\ni=1 R2\ni\n\u0011\n.\nFor a PDF f(⃗R), the MC replica can be constructed as 9\nf(k) ≡ f0 +\nDX\ni=1\nf+i − f−i\n2 R(k)\ni , (A1)\nwith only the linear term kept on the right-hand side. For Nrep → ∞, the MC estimators\nfor the mean PDF ⟨f⟩, the PDF uncertainty δMCf, and PDF-PDF correlation CMC(f1, f2),\ngiven respectively in Eqs.

The decay of the charm hadron can result in one\nor more tracks whose impact parameter is signiﬁcantly\ndisplaced from the interaction point.\nWe match tracks to a jet and compute the distance\nof closest approach to the interaction point in thex−y\nplane (d0) and along the z-axis (z0).

The signed impact parameter, sIP3D\n(Fig. 6), is obtained by multiplyingIP3D with the sign\nof the product ⃗ pj ·⃗ rtrack, where ⃗ pj is the parent jet\nmomentum and ⃗ rtrack is a vector that points from the\ninteraction point to the point of closest approach on the\ntrack.\nA basic optimization of the tagger parameters was per-\nformed by maximizing the signiﬁcance of the background-\nsubtracted charm jet yield assuming a target integrated\nluminosity of 100 fb−1.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION\nWe have explored the experimental feasibility of charm-\njet cross-section measurements in charged-current DIS at\nthe future Electron-Ion Collider. We use parametrized\ndetector simulations with the Delphes package with\nbaseline parameters for the EIC detectors. We es-\ntimated the performance of an high-impact-parameter\ntrack-counting algorithm to tag charm jets. We also\nexplored the potential of particle identiﬁcation to incre-\nment tagging eﬃciency. Our feasibility studies suggest\nthat the prospects for constraining unpolarized nucleon\nstrangeness are rather promising in this channel. These\ngoals represent a challenge that demands high luminosity\nas well as a well-designed EIC detector with good capa-\nbilities for measuring displaced vertices, particle ID, jets,\nand missing-transverse energy. As such, it represents a\nrobust platform on which to inform the design of the EIC\ndetectors.\nThe charm-tagging performance studies advanced in\nthis work have the potential to extend the rapidly emerg-\ning ﬁeld of jet studies for the future EIC [25–30, 78, 81–\n116].

INTRODUCTION\nOwing to steady theoretical progress and the growing availability of computational resources, the ability of per-\nturbative QCD (pQCD) to predict parton-level processes at high energies has continued to improve in recent years,\nwith accuracies now reaching next-to-next-to-leading order (N2LO) in many circumstances. Inevitably, however,\npredictions for experiments involving hadronic collisions require precise knowledge of the structure of initial-state\nhadrons at comparatively small energy scales similar to the nucleon mass,Λ∼M, at whichαs(Λ)∼1 is too large to\npermit a converging diagrammatic expansion of the relevant amplitudes. This general consequence of the negative\nβ-function of QCD is realized in the theory of spin-averaged deeply-inelastic lepton-nucleon scattering, for example,\nin the factorization of physical cross sections into perturbatively calculable short-distance matrix elements and inher-\nently nonperturbative long-distance parton distribution functions (PDFs),q(x,µ), of the quark-to-hadron light-front\nmomentum fractionx= k+/p+ and factorization scaleµ.\nGiven the nonperturbative nature of the collinear PDFs, the prevailing recourse has traditionally been either to\nﬁt them in comprehensive analyses of global data using ﬂexible parametric forms [2–6], or to calculate them in the\ncontext of models or eﬀective theories [7–16] that aim to capture speciﬁc aspects of QCD —e.g., its pattern of\ndynamical chiral symmetry breaking.

Parallel to these eﬀorts, the past couple of decades have\nseen a complementary eﬀort founded in the use of lattice gauge theory techniques to either indirectly compute thex\ndependence of the PDFs themselves, or, at minimum, determine the integrated moments of the parton distributions\nin Mellin space. (For a comprehensive review, we refer the reader to the recent white paper, Ref. [19].)\nBy deﬁnition, the PDFs are intrinsically nonlocal correlation functions constructed between parton ﬁelds with\nlightlike spacetime separation along the ξ− direction at ﬁxed light-front time ξ+ = 0 : viz., ∼⟨p|¯q(ξ−) ˆOq(0)|p⟩.\nDynamically simulating such matrix elements on a hypercubic lattice, however, is numerically problematic, given\nthe fact 1 that x2 = x+x−−x2\n⊥ = 0 can only trivially hold at the origin in a Euclidean spacetime, for which\nx2\nE = x2\n1 + ···+ x2\n4.

In principle, it is possible to reconstruct a\ngiven PDF’sx dependence via an inverse Mellin transformif its moments⟨xn⟩q are known to all orders, as noted in\nSec.

These PDF Mellin moments have the general form\n⟨xn⟩q =\n∫ 1\n0\ndx xn[q(x) + (−1)n+1 q(x)] . (3)\nUsing Eq.

These are\n⟨xn⟩q+ = ⟨xn⟩q for n= 2ℓ−1, (4a)\n⟨xn⟩q− = ⟨xn⟩q for n= 2ℓ, (4b)\nwhere ℓ ∈Z+ such that the lattice may provide, for instance,⟨x⟩u+ , ⟨x2⟩u−, ⟨x3⟩u+ , etc. Moreover, the PDFs\nthemselves can be unfolded from a complete set of Mellin moments via the inverse Mellin transform,\nq(x) + (−1)n+1 q(x) = 1\n2πi\n∫ c+i∞\nc−i∞\ndnx−n−1 ⟨xn⟩q .

III) might eventually be\nimplemented asχ2 penalties in global QCD analyses — essentially, taking lattice data as theoretical priors to constrain\nthe likelihood function of a global ﬁt. For example, exploratory studies based on Bayesian proﬁling have suggested\nthat lattice calculations even with somewhat sizable uncertainties can still provide powerful constraints to PDFs in\nregions that are relatively unconstrained by experimental data (see Ref.

It is then possible\nto calculate these coeﬃcients in the context of QCD perturbatively (i.e., they embody the relevant short-distance\ndynamics), while the local operator matrix elements are nonperturbative (depending on the details of the long-distance\nphysics).

Additional numerical\ndetails can be found on the companion website, Ref. [58]. In this context, there is a pronounced inﬂuence of the\ncombined HERAI+II experiment due to the extremely large number of measurements (Npt = 1120) taken — and\ndespite the fact that only a minimal number of these exhibit per-point sensitivities that exceed the highlighting cut\n|Sf|>0.25 imposed on the impact maps in this analysis.\nContinuing, the right panel of Fig. 3 also shows the corresponding distribution of CTEQ-TEA sensitivities in(x, µ)\nspace for the second isovector moment⟨x2⟩u−−d−, for which the constraints arising from indiv"}

Unlike these combinations, the moments of ﬂavor-separated distributions likeu+(x,µlat)\nand d+(x,µlat) receive contributions from both connected and disconnected insertions. The disconnected insertions\narise from Wick contractions of quark ﬁelds not explicitly present in interpolation operators used to construct the\n2-point function associated with the nucleon propagator; disconnected insertions are therefore essentially equally\npresent in bothu-type and d-type ﬂavor-separated moments. Unfortunately, evaluating disconnected insertions on\nthe lattice is computationally expensive and, historically, has proved challenging."}

For the second moment of theu− distribution, the leading point-averaged sensitivities are\ndue to ﬁxed-target DIS experiments and the7 TeV CMS lepton charge asymmetries, led by CCFR-F3’97 (0.503);\nbeyond this, experiments with⟨|Sf|⟩> 0.2 are CMS7Masy2’14 (0.413), CDHSW-F3’91 (0.248), and CMS7Easy’12\n(0.244). In this context, the fact that information on the parity-odd structure functionFp\n3 — especially as provided\nby CCFR-F3’97 — shows such sizable inﬂuence over⟨x2⟩u− is consistent with the leading-order∼q−¯q behavior of\nFp\n3 in the quark-parton model. As such, thorough knowledge of thex dependence ofxF3 facilitates an unraveling of\nthe C-odd distributions of theq−type, and constrains their higher moments.

In fact, these systematic diﬀerences are especially marked for the⟨x2⟩moments, as inspection\nof Fig. 6 attests. Especially notable in the right panel of Fig. 6 is the very strong sensitivity|Sf|≳ 0.75 for a select\nsubset of the gauge production data, particularly forx ≳ 10−4 and separately forx ≳ 0.1. These especially strong\nconstraints to⟨x2⟩d− originate from an amalgam of electroweak data sets, among which we ﬁnd the8 TeV forward\nW±,Z productioncrosssectiondataofLHCb(LHCb8WZ’16), theanalogousinformationat 7 TeV(LHCb7ZWrap’15),\nas well as the forward-backwarde+e−asymmetry inW±,Z production at Runs 1 and 2 of CDF, CDF1Wasy’96 and\nCDF2Wasy’05. Compared with⟨x2⟩u−, on the other hand, for the second moment ofd−(x) we ﬁnd a substantially\nmore restricted outlay of individual high-impact measurements in the ﬁxed-target region, with signiﬁcantly fewer\ndata belonging to very highx≳ 0.4 or x≲ 0.2 identiﬁed. Of these, the E605, NMCrat, and CCFR-F3 points enjoy\nspecial prominence. Many of these trends revealed by the sensitivity map in the right panel of Fig. 6 are further\nconﬁrmed by quantitative ranking of the CTEQ-TEA experiments, especially based on the per-point sensitivities."}

Flavor asymmetries of the nucleon sea\nAs a ﬁnal consideration in this section, we examine the sensitivities to linear combinations of the Mellin moments\nthat quantify breaking of ﬂavorSU(3) symmetry of the nucleon’s light-quark sea. The ﬂavor structure of the proton’s\nquark sea has for decades attracted sustained focus, especially regarding the dynamical origin of the observed charge-\nﬂavor asymmetry embodied by the breaking of theSU(3)ﬂavor PDF relation ¯u(x) = ¯d(x) =s(x) = ¯s(x) often assumed\nin the earliest phenomenological QCD global ﬁts. Much formal interest in this topic attends to the fact that the\nx-dependent breaking of theSU(2) symmetry relation ¯d(x,µ)−¯u(x,µ) = 0 at low scales is principally understood\nas a feature of nonperturbative QCD [59, 60]; for instance, patterns of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking in QCD\nfavor hadronic dissociations of the proton having the formp →π+n at low energies, which are thought to produce\ngeneric excesses of ¯d over ¯u in contributing to the nucleon’s ﬂavor structure [61–63].

This logic extends especially to an understanding of thePz dependence\nof the matched qPDFs, which can be particularly sensitive to power-corrections and the perturbative order of the\nmatching formalism.\nThus, to illustrate the current knowledge of qPDFspredicted using Eq. (2), Fig. 9 displays the qPDFs derived from\nthe CT14HERA2 NNLO PDFs forPz = 1.5 and 3 GeV, together with the bands of current uncertainties on these\nqPDFs estimated at the 90% probability level. The uncertainties are computed according to the Hessian master\nformula (16) from CT14HERA2 NNLO error sets. The error bands for the collinear CT14HERA2 NNLO PDFs are\nalso shown, labeled as “MS PDFs”. In fact, a Hessian error set for the qPDFs at a givenPz, ˜µ, andµcan be obtained\nby applying Eq. (2) to each error set of the CT14HERA2 NNLO ensemble. This algorithm is entirely analogous to\nthe calculation of the error ensemble for the Mellin moments using Eq. (12).

MOTIVATION FOR FUTURE EXPERIMENTS\nA number of futuristic machines have either been proposed or planned with a stated aim (among other physics\nmotivations) of disentangling the collinear structure of hadronic states, including various futuristic hadron-collider\nexperiments like the HL-LHC [69] and,e.g., the AFTER@CERN proposal [70]. Among these proposals, a number of\nlepton-hadron colliders have been advocated, especially a future US-based electron-ion collider (EIC) [71–74] and a\nlepton-nucleon/nucleus variant of the LHC, the Large Hadron-Electron Collider (LHeC) [75]. An EIC, in particular,\nis most likely to serve the dedicated role of a hadron tomography machine, given its high-luminosity coverage of the\ncrucial few-GeV quark-hadron transition region in the kinematical parameter space. An EIC would enjoy unprece-\ndented facility in unfolding the nucleon’s collinear and transverse structure at scales adjacent to the nucleon mass,\n≳M. The science output of an EIC would greatly build upon the JLab12 program [76], while the kinematic coverage\nof an EIC would be particularly favorable for constraining the quantities accessible in next-generation lattice QCD\ncalculations.\nAs a simple illustration of the potential of a future DIS program, we compute the sensitivity maps that result\nfrom implementing a set of pseudodata into thePDFSense framework and examining our impact metrics for the ﬁrst\nmoment of the isovector distribution⟨x⟩u+−d+ and the high-x behavior of thePz = 1.5 GeV isovector quark quasi-\ndistribution [˜u−˜d](x,Pz,˜µ).

For this example, cross section pseudodata are produced in bins speciﬁed by a realistic\nMonte Carlo event generator about the CT14HERA2 NNLO theoretical prediction with a Gaussian smearing function\nof standard deviation equal to the an assumed uncorrelated error taken from the Monte Carlo simulation.

Details of the nuclear binding\nat work in the deuteron, for instance, are relevant for a number of the CTEQ-TEA sets, including BCDMSd’90,\nNMCrat’97, and E866rat’01. On the other hand, heavier nuclear systems were probed in several other ﬁxed-target\nexperiments, especially those involvingνDIS; these include CDHSW (bothF2 and F3 sets, measured on Fe), the\ninclusive CCFR and semi-inclusive dimuon data from NuTeV and CCFR (all also measured on Fe), and the E605\nﬁxed-target pADrell-Yan measurements (Cu target). In multiple instances — for example, in the impact plots for the\nstrangeness moments⟨x1,3⟩s+ , theC-odd combinations⟨x2⟩u−,d−, and even the gluon total momentum⟨x⟩g — these\nexperiments represent the ﬁrst, second, or third most inﬂuential information by the aggregated or point-averaged\nsensitivity, or both.\nPresent phenomenological constraints, particularly at largex, are therefore strongly dependent on data for which\nnuclear corrections are an important consideration.

IMPLEMENTATION OF LATTICE DATA IN QCD ANALYSES\nIn the foregoing sections we have analyzed various empirical constraints uponindividual lattice QCD observables\nwhich are either presently accessible or expected to be in the foreseeable future. These experimental data were taken\neither from the CTEQ-TEA high-energy data set or generated as hypothetical pseudodata recorded at an EIC-like\ne±pDIS collider. The main purpose of this exploration was to identify the experimental processes and measurements\nthat will impose the strongest constraints on the lattice-calculable quantities dependent on the PDFs, and that thus\ncan serve as stringent phenomenological benchmarks to help lattice calculations reach their maturity.\nBut to this latter point, is it possible to proceed in the direction converse to the one taken by asking: how\nmight the multifaceted results of lattice QCD constrain thex dependence of collinear PDFs ﬁtted in future global\nanalyses? Given the complexity of the multichannel information on the Mellin moments and qPDFs furnished by the\nlattice, its inclusion in the upcoming PDF ﬁts may produce a plethora of nontrivial constraints on the underlying\nparametrizations. Rather than attempting to disentangle the many potential eﬀects from the implementation of lattice\ndata into a global ﬁt, we will usePDFSense to investigate some general properties, such as the typical momentu"}

On the other hand, the PDF correlations with higher moments are rather diﬀerent, in\nthis case being quite modest, especially for the highestn= 5 moment, over most of the plotted range before becoming\nvery large,Cf∼1, atx≳0.3.

Taken in conjunction with the\ncorrelation results shown in Fig. 16, we may infer that the sensitivity of high-x data to higher moments follows from\nan underlying reciprocal relation that connects the high-x behavior of PDFs to their higher-order Mellin moments.\nThe observation that moments⟨xn⟩q± of successively higher order (n≥1) are increasingly sensitive to the PDFs’\nlarge-xbehavior provides an impetus to seek alternative moment-weighting functions which may be sensitive to lowx.\nOne possible choice would be s"}

The chief message of this article is that this\nrepresents an opportunity to form a potentially powerfully synergy between phenomenological PDF analyses and\nlattice QCD. This synergy will be grounded in the ability of PDF phenomenologists to drive improvements in lattice\ncalculations with benchmarks informed by high-energy data, while the lattice provides informative constraints in\nkinematical regions that are otherwise challenging to constrain empirically.

This\nfact suggests one avenue for assessing the empirical origins of phenomenological predictions of lattice data, and a path\nforward for improving them.\nWhile some studies have investigated the result of selecting assortments of lattice data for inclusion into a global\nanalysis, in this work we have gone the other direction and examined the constraints data place on a quantities which\nhave been computed on the lattice. In the process, we have established several primary ﬁndings:\n• We have demonstrated the correspondence between phenomenological predictions for speciﬁc physical measure-\nments and the importance of experimental information for benchmarking lattice calculations. Conversely, our\nimpact study in the form of the sensitivity maps for the various lattice observables illustrates those regions of\nparameter space where improved lattice data can be expected to have a driving impact on PDF studies. For\ninstance, precise lattice data on⟨x⟩d+ could improve knowledge ofd+(x) in the high-x region, given the sensi-\ntivity map of Fig. 4 (right panel) and the correlations plotted in Fig. 16. Similar logic applies to the moments\nof other ﬂavors.\n• In Sec. II, we found that that most moments presently accessible to the lattice are mainly constrained by\na small collection of high-impact experiments — for many of the light quark Mellin moments, for instance, a\ncombination of HERA and ﬁxed-target DIS data are especially decisive, as illustrated for theu+−d+, u+, "}

The overall sensitivities of the CTEQ-TEA experiments\nto the quantities considered in this analysis are summarized in Figs. 13 and 14, as well as Tables II-IV. The\nCTEQ-TEA data pulls diﬀer substantially for even vs. odd Mellin moments, due to theC-oddness vs. evenness\nof the associated quark distributions, seen by comparing the sensitivity maps of Fig. 4 against those of Fig. 6.\n• We have also observed systematic tendencies in the sensitivities of high-energy data to Mellin moments, including\na robust connection between the ordern of the Mellin moments⟨xn⟩q± of quark distributions and regions of\nx of the PDFs shown in Fig. 15. This connection is ‘bidirectional’ in the sense that experimental information\nat higherx are likely to exert stronger pulls on higher-order Mellin moments, while lattice information on the\nhigher-order moments may potentially constrain the high-x behavior of ﬁtted PDFs.

One intriguing consequence of this is the possibility of more thoroughly constraining the\nPz dependence of the phenomenologically-matched qPDFs with,e.g., DIS measurements concentrated at large\nx shown in Fig. 10. Reductions to the PDF uncertainties of the high-x qPDFs could help drive theoretical\nimprovements in the LaMET formalism used to extract PDFs from lattice data.\n• We can assess the potential impact of future experiments like the high-luminosity lepton-nucleon collider consid-\nered in Fig. 12, and we conclude that data from such a machine would be extremely beneﬁcial for advancing the\nphenomenology of PDF moments and matched qPDFs.

INTRODUCTION\nThe determination of collinear parton distribution functions (PDFs) of the nucleon is becoming an increasingly\nprecise discipline with the advent of high-luminosity experiments at both colliders and ﬁxed-target facilities. Several\nresearch groups are involved in the rich research domain of the modern PDF analysis [1–7]. By quantifying the\ndistribution of a parent hadron’s longitudinal momentum among its constituent quarks and gluons, PDFs oﬀer both\na description of the hadronic structure and an essential ingredient of perturbative QCD computations. PDFs enjoy\na symbiotic relationship with high-energy experimental data, in the sense that they are crucial for understanding\nhadronic collisions in the Standard Model (SM) and beyond, while reciprocally beneﬁting from a wealth of high-\nenergy data that constrain the PDFs. In fact, since the start of the Large Hadron Collider Run II (LHC Run II), the\nvolume of experimental data pertinent to the PDFs is growing with such speed that keeping pace with the rapidly\nexpanding datasets and isolating measurements of greatest impact presents a signiﬁcant challenge for PDF ﬁtters. This\npaper intends to meet this challenge by presenting a method for identifying high-value experiments which constrain\nthe PDFs and the resulting SM predictions that depend on them.\nThat such expansive datasets can constrain the PDFs is a consequence of the latter’s universality — a feature\nwhich relies upon QCD factorization theorems to separate the inherently nonperturbative PDFs (at long distances)\nfrom process-dependent, short-distance matri"}

With the proliferation of potentially informative new data, incorporating them\nall into a global QCD ﬁt inevitably incurs signiﬁcant cost both in terms of computational resources and required\nﬁtting time. Indeed, tremendous progress in the precision of PDFs and robustness of SM predictions is driven by\nthe technology for performing global analysis that has vastly grown in complexity and sophistication. Nowadays,\nthe state-of-the-art in perturbative QCD (pQCD) treatments are done at NNLO (and increasingly even N 3LO), and\nadvanced statistical techniques are commonly employed in PDF error estimation. The magnitude of this subject is\nvast, and we refer the interested reader to Refs. [8, 9] for comprehensive reviews. The tradeoﬀ of this progress is that\nthe impact of an experiment on the ultimate PDF uncertainty is often hard to foresee without doing a complicated ﬁt.\nVarious publications claim sensitivity of new experiments to the PDFs. In this paper, we look into these claims using\nstatistical techniques that bypass doing the ﬁts, and with an eye on theoretical, experimental, and methodological\ncomponents relevant at the NNLO precision.\nThe potential cost is steepened by the large size of the global datasets usually involved.

Details of the datasets\ncorresponding to the short-hand names given in the legend may be found in Tables II–IV.\nestimate the impact of new experimental data on full global ﬁts, such as Hessian proﬁling techniques [11] and Bayesian\nreweighting [12, 13] of PDFs. Although these approaches do simulate the expansion of a particular global ﬁt by\nincluding theretofore absent dataset(s), they are also limited in that the interpretation of their outcomes is married to\nthe speciﬁc PDF parametrization and deﬁnition of PDF errors. For example, conclusions obtained by PDF reweighting\nregarding the importance of a given data set strongly depend on the assumed statistical tolerance or the choice of\nreweighting factors [14, 15].\nParallel to these eﬀorts, the notion of using correlations between the PDF uncertainties of two "}

III A, embodies\nthe Pearson correlation coeﬃcient computed by a generalization of the “master formula” [18] for the Hessian PDF\nuncertainty. The Hessian correlation was deployed extensively in Ref.

The Pearson correlation coeﬃcient has also proven to be informative in the approach based on Monte-Carlo\nPDF replicas, see, e.g., Refs. [20, 21]. However, the PDF-mediated correlation with a theoretical cross section is only\npartly indicative of the sensitivity of the experiment.

PDF PRELIMINARIES\nA. Data residuals in a global QCD analysis\nWhile various theoretical models exist for computing nucleon PDFs [34–36], unambiguous evaluation of the PDFs\nentirely in terms of QCD theory is not yet possible due to the fact that the PDFs can in general receive substantial\nnonperturbative contributions at infrared momenta. For this reason, precise PDF determination has proceeded mainly\nthrough the technique of the QCD global analysis — a method enabled by QCD factorization and PDF universality.\nIn this approach, a highly ﬂexible parametric form is ascribed for the various ﬂavors in a given analysis at a relatively\nlow scale Q2\n0. For example, one might take the input PDF for a given quark ﬂavor f to be a parametric form\nf(x,µ2 = Q2\n0) = Af,0 xAf,1 (1 −x)Af,2 F(x; Af,3,... ) , (2)\nin which F(x; Af,3,... ) can be a suitable polynomial function, e.g., a Chebyshev or Bernstein polynomial, or replaced\nwith a feed-forward neural network NN f(x) as in the NNPDF approach. While the full statistical theory for PDF\ndetermination and error quantiﬁcation is beyond the intended range of this analysis, roughly speaking, a best ﬁt is\nfound for a vector ⃗Aof N PDF parameters Al by minimizing a goodness-of-ﬁt function χ2 describing agreement of the\nQCD data and physical observables computed in terms of the PDFs. Based on the behavior of χ2 in the neighborhood\nof the global minimum, it is then possible to construct an ensemble of error PDFs to quantify uncertainties of PDFs\nat a predetermined probability level.\nThere are various ways to evaluate uncertainties on PDFs, e.g"}

In this analysis our default PDF input set is CT14HERA2, which uses the\nHessian method to estimate uncertainties and is therefore based on the quadratic assumption for χ2( ⃗A) in the vicinity\nof the global minimum. In the Hessian method, an orthonormal basis of PDF parameters ⃗ ais derived from the input\nPDF parameters ⃗A by the diagonalization of a Hessian matrix H, which encodes the second-order derivatives of χ2\nwith respect to Al.

With the deﬁnitions in Eqs.\n(13) and (14), however, ⃗δi is only weakly sensitive to χ2\nE/Npt .\nThus, we represent the PDF-driven variations of the residuals of a global dataset by a bundle of vectors ⃗δi in a\n2N-dimensional space.2 This mapping opens the door to applying various data-analytical methods for classiﬁcation\nof the data points and identifying the data points of the utmost utility for PDF ﬁts. As the length of ⃗δi is equal\nto the PDF-induced fractional error on ri as compared to the average residual at the best ﬁt, it can be argued that\nimportant PDF constraints arise from new data points that either have a large |⃗δi|or are otherwise distinct from the\nexisting data points. Conversely, new data points with a small |⃗δi|, or the ones that are embedded in the preexisting\nclusters of points, are not likely to improve constraints on the PDFs.\n1 As a result, a small number of data points that contributes to both the data sets CMS7jets’14 and CMS7jets’13 is double-counted in\nthe histograms, without aﬀecting the conclusions.\n2 In this section, we consider separate variations along ⃗ al in the positive and negative directions.

The underlying reasons for this separation, namely, dependence\non independent PDF combinations, will be quantiﬁed by the sensitivities in the next section.\nAs an alternative, the Embedding Projector can organize the ⃗δi vectors into clusters according to their similarity\nusing t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) [45]. A representative 3-dimensional distribution of the\nvectors obtained by t-SNE is displayed in the right panel of Fig. 3. In the ﬁgure, we show that the t-SNE method is\nable to identify and separate the clusters of data according to the experimental process (DIS, vector production, or\njet production). In fact, the reader can perform the t-SNE analysis on the Embedding Projector website themselves\nand verify that it actually sorts the ⃗δi vectors into the clusters according to their values of x and µ, and even the\nexperiment itself. This exercise demonstrates, yet again, that the statistical residuals provided in PDFSense reﬂect\nthe key properties of the global ﬁt.

The same conclusion applies to\ndata from high- pT Z production, which has too few points to stand out in a ﬁt with signiﬁcant inclusive jet data\nsamples. We return to this point in the discussion of reciprocated distances below.\nIt is also interesting to note that semi-inclusive charm production at HERA [HERAc’13] lies between, and partly\noverlaps with, the DIS and jet clusters. Finally, CCFR/NuTeV dimuon semi-inclusive DIS [SIDIS] (CCFR-F2’01,\nCCFR-F3’97, NuTeV-nu’06, NuTeV-nub’06) extends in an orthogonal direction, not well separated from the other\ndatasets in the selected three-dimensional projection."}

II. For this demonstration, we will continue to study the dataset shown in Fig. 1 of the CT14HERA2\nanalysis [10] augmented by the candidate LHC data.\nWe have already noted the extent of this dataset in the{x,µ}plane in Fig. 1, where it is decomposed into constituent\nexperiments labeled according to the conventions in Tables II-IV. It is instructive to create similar maps in the {x,µ}\nplane showing the Cf or Sf values for each data point. Such maps are readily produced by the PDFSense program\nfor a variety of PDF ﬂavors and for user-deﬁned observables, such as the Higgs cross section. For demonstration we\nhave collected a large number of these maps at the companion website [43]. We invite the reader to review these\nadditional ﬁgures while reading the paper to validate the conclusions that will be summarized below.\nThus, we obtain scatter plots of Cf(xi,µi) or Sf(xi,µi) for a given QCD observable f = σ, such as the LHC Higgs\nproduction cross section shown in Fig. 2, or with a PDF f evaluated at the same {xi,µi}determined by the data\npoints, with examples shown for g(xi,µi) in Figs. 7 and 8.

At the same time, many\nother measurements, including ﬁxed-target data at large x and W asymmetry data near µ∼100 GeV, have feeble\ncorrelations with g(xi,µi) and would therefore be less emphasized by an analysis based solely upon the PDF-residual\ncorrelations.\nWe can also consider the analogous plots for the sensitivity |Sg|(xi,µi) as deﬁned in Eq. (21), which we plot in\nFig. 8. In the ﬁrst panel, we again consider the histogram, here for the magnitudes of the gluon sensitivity |Sg|(xi,µi),\nin which the correlations |Cg|are now weighted by the relative size of the PDF uncertainty ∆ ri in the residual. As\ndiscussed in Sec. III B, this additional weighting emphasizes those data points for which the PDF-driven ﬂuctuations\nin the residuals are comparatively large relatively to experimental uncertainties. This leads to a redistribution of the\ndata points shown in the |Cg|histogram of Fig. 7, with the result being a considerably longer-tailed histogram for\n|Sg|such that, in this instance, there are 546 raw data points with larger sensitivities, |Sf|≥ 0.25, indicated by the\nhorizontal blue bar. Unlike the correlation, |Sg|can be arbitrarily large, depending on the ∆ ri value.

In contrast to the |Cg|plot, we observe increased\nsensitivity in the precise ﬁxed-target DIS data from BCDMS (BCDMSp’89, BCDMSd’90) and CCFR (CCFR-F2’01,\nCCFR-F3’97), which are sensitive to the gluon via scaling violations despite only moderate correlation values. Simi-\nlarly, we observe heightened sensitivities at highest x for the LHC (CMS7jets’14, ATLAS7jets’15, CMS8jets’17) and\nTevatron (D02jets’08) jet production data, which have both large correlations with g(xi,µi) and small experimental\nuncertainties. Sensitivity |Sg|of LHC jet experiments, CMS7jets’14, ATLAS7jets’15, CMS8jets’17, varies in a large\nrange, and can signiﬁcantly improve, depending on the implementation of experimental systematic uncertainties in\nthe analysis, cf. the discussion of the jet data in the next section.\nWe also observe enhanced sensitivity for individual points in a large number of experiments, including CDHSW\nDIS (CDHSW-F2’91); HERA FL (HERA-FL’11); the Drell-Yan process (E605’91, E866pp’03); CDF 8 TeV W\ncharge asymmetry (CMS7Masy2’14); HERA charm SIDIS (HERAc’13); ATLAS high-pT Z production (ATL7ZpT’14,\nATL8ZpT’16); and especially strongly sensitive points in t¯tproduction (ATL8ttb-pt’16, ATL8ttb-y ave’16, "}

Turning back to the distributions of |CσH|(xi,µi) and |SσH|(xi,µi) for the Higgs cross section σH\nat √s= 14 TeV in Fig. 2, we notice that they largely reﬂect the distributions of |Cg|(xi,µi) and |Sg|(xi,µi) around\nx∼MH/√s= 125/14000 = 0.009 and µ= MH = 125 GeV. We also see some diﬀerences: although the average xand\nµare ﬁxed in σH, it is nonetheless sensitive to some constraints at much lower xvalues as a result of the momentum\nsum rule.\nThe reader is welcome to examine the plots of sensitivities and correlations available on the PDFSense website for\na large collection of PDF ﬂavors and PDF ratios, such as d/u, d/u, and (s+ s)/\n(\nu+ d\n)\n. Sensitivities for other PDF\ncombinations and hadronic cross sections can be computed and plotted in a matter of minutes using the PDFSense\nprogram. We will now turn to another aspect of this analysis: summarizing the abundant information contained in\nthe sensitivity plots. For this purpose, we will introduce numerical indicators and propose a practical procedure to\nrank the experimental data sets according to their sensitivities to the PDFs or PDF-dependent observables of interest.\nB.

For the purpose of identifying such experiments, we can compute an overall sensitivity statistic for each\nexperiment E to the parton distributions fa(xi,µi) evaluated at the same kinematic parameters {xi,µi}as the data.\nFurthermore, to obtain one overall ranking, we can add up sensitivity measures as an unweighted sum over the “basis\nPDF” ﬂavors, such as the six light ﬂavors ( d, u, g, u, d, s). To obtain these measures, we say that an experiment E\nconsisting of Npt physical measurements can be characterized by its mean sensitivity per raw data point4 to a PDF of\ngiven ﬂavor fa(x,µ): ⟨|SE\nf |⟩≡ (Npt )−1 ∑Npt\ni=1 |Sf|(xi,µi), from which we derive several additional statistical measures\nof experimental sensitivity.

(A2) implies that\na measurement in a single rapidity bin can in fact probe two distinct values of x; for this and other potential reasons,\nthe number of raw data points in such an experiment (Npt ) should not be expected to match the number of extracted\n{x,µ}points in the ﬁgures.\nIn vector boson production, AB →(γ∗,Z →ℓ¯ℓ)X or AB →(W →ℓνℓ)X, we set Q= mℓ¯ℓ (invariant mass of the\nlepton pair), and yC = yℓ if a single-lepton rapidity is provided or yC = yℓ¯ℓ if the lepton-pair rapidity is provided.\nIf the rapidity yℓ of the lepton is known, yet yℓ¯ℓ of the pair is unknown, we use the fact that yℓ ∼yℓ¯ℓ ±1 for most\nevents because of the shape of the decay leptonic tensor. Thus, the momentum fractions x±\ni can still be estimated as\nx±\ni ≈(Q/√s) exp(±y)|i, where y∼yℓ (up to an error of less than 1 unit)\nIn single-inclusive jet production, AB →j+ X, we set Q= 2pTj, yC = yj.\nIn single-inclusive t¯t pair production, AB →t¯tX, "}

How do the conﬁned\nhadronic states emerge from these quarks and gluons? How do the quark-gluon interactions create nuclear\nbinding?\nIn addressing these questions, the EIC will undertake a broad program of fundamental QCD measurements, with\nserious implications for current and future HEP programs, as we explore in the sections below.\nThe EIC will provide capabilities of colliding beams of polarized electrons with polarized beams of protons and light\nions. A schematic perspective of the planned EIC is shown in Fig. 1. The EIC will collide electrons with protons and\nnuclei in the intermediate energy range between ﬁxed-target scattering facilities and high energy colliders, see Fig. 2\nfor a comparison with similar facilities globally.

BEYOND STANDARD MODEL PHYSICS AT EIC\nEditors: Yulia Furletova, Ciprian Gal, Claire Gwenlan.\nEIC will provide orders of magnitude higher luminosity compared to HERA, the only electron-proton collider\noperated to date. It will be the ﬁrst lepton-ion collider that polarizes both the electron and the proton (ion) beams,\nand the ﬁrst collider with the capacity to ﬂip its electron beam helicity at the source level. These unique design\nfeatures will allow a direct extraction of parity-violating components of the electroweak (EW) neutral-current (NC)\nscattering cross section and the ﬁrst (and possibly the only) measurement of the polarized NC structure functions.\nThe high luminosity of the EIC will also provide better sensitivity to charged-current EW physics, rare processes such\nas charged lepton ﬂavor violation, heavy photons, and searches for Lorentz- and CPT-violating eﬀects. In addition\nto providing measurements in an energy and luminosity range hardly explored before, the energy range of the EIC\nwill provide a unique opportunity for the nuclear and high-energy physics communities to collaborate closely and to\nadvance EW and beyond-the-Standard-Model (BSM) physics together.\n2.1. Neutral Current Electro-Weak and BSM Physics\n2.1.1. Deep Inelastic Scattering Cross Sections\nThe cross section of Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS) can be divided into four contributions that depend on the\nelectron and ion polarization: the unpolarized cross section σ0, the single-spin polarized cross sections σe and σp, and\nthe double-spin polarized cross section σep:\nd2σ\ndxdy = d2σ0\ndxdy + Pe\nd2σe"}

Similarly, if the electron beam is unpolarized and the proton (or ion)\nbeam is longitudinally polarized, one forms the so-called polarized PV asymmetry\nAp(d)\nPV ≡σp\nσ0\n, (2.8)\nwhich can provide constraints on polarized PDFs via the determination of the gγZ\n1,4,5 structure functions, or a simul-\ntaneous determination of the PDF and EW NC couplings.\nProjections for A(e)\nPV were performed using the ECCE detector conﬁguration [4] and the luminosity from Table 10.1\nof the EIC Yellow Report [5].

The main systematic uncertainties included particle\nbackground (1% relative in each bin, completely uncorrelated among all ( x,Q2) bins), and electron polarization (1%\nrelative in each bin, completely correlated among all ( x,Q2) bins of data of the same √s).

Signals of this general possibility have been studied for a variety experimental settings in Refs. [38, 41, 42].\nIn Ref. [43], it was pointed out that electron-ion collisions at the future EIC can provide an excellent opportunity to\nprobe such interactions, in particular for e−τ CLFV mediated by ALPs in the ∼GeV or higher mass range. Coherent\nelectromagnetic scattering at low q2 from a high- Z ion – like the gold nucleus with Z = 79 – can lead to signiﬁcant\nproduction of ALPs from the electron beam, accompanied by a τ lepton in the ﬁnal state. In addition, electron beam\npolarization can be used to probe the parity properties of the ALP leptonic couplings. The relatively high center\nof mass energy √s ∼100 GeV achievable at the EIC [5] allows it to probe the ALP e−τ CLFV coupling, Cτe/Λ,\nwell below other projected limits, for ALP masses up to ∼few ×10 GeV, with 100 fb −1 of integrated luminosity.\nThese results are shown in Fig. 8. Between the left panel and the right panel, the ﬂavor diagonal ALP couplings are\nreduced, which makes other probes less eﬀective but does not change the EIC reach at all.

The success of\nthis program in stringently testing the SM and performing impactful measurements at the TeV-scale is dependent upon\nimprovements to modern knowledge of the internal structure of hadrons. This dependence is realized in numerous\ncircumstances, including the substantial PDF limitations to determinations of standard-candle measurements at\npp colliders, including the Higgs cross section, gauge-boson masses, and electroweak couplings and mixing angles.\nSimultaneously, a number of HEP activities on the Intensity and Neutrino Frontiers, including the upcoming program\nat LBNF/DUNE, are similarly precision-limited by both single-nucleon and nuclear uncertainties. In the case of\nLBNF/DUNE, these uncertainties come primarily in the form of incomplete knowledge of neutrino-nuclear ( νA)\ninteractions for neutrino energies falling within the few-GeV region, Eν∼few GeV.

The TMD FFs are one of the key tools necessary for investigating\nthe mechanism of hadronization in a 3D-picture. Historically, they have been accessed through Semi-Inclusive DIS\n(SIDIS) and e+e− annihilation in two almost back-to-back hadrons. However, phenomenological extractions based\non such processes are complicated by the fact that, in the cross section, the TMD FF does not appears on its own,\nbut it is always convoluted to another TMD (two TMD FFs in e+e−annihilations, one TMD PDF and one TMD FF\nin SIDIS). Disentangling these functions is usually a rather diﬃcult task. This problem can be bypassed provided we\ncan extend the TMD factorization scheme to cross sections that involve only one TMD FF. In this sense, the cleanest\nprocess that allows to access one TMD FF is the single hadron production in e+e−annihilations, e+e−→hX, which\ninvolves a single TMD FF associated to the ﬁnal detected hadron.

In particular,\ngeneralised parton distributions (GPDs) oﬀer a rigorous theoretical framework that can be used to study the 3D\nstructure of nucleons [250–252]. These objects describe the partonic structure of hadrons and, to some extent, may be\nconsidered a unifying basis subsuming the collinear PDFs and elastic form factors.

These\npictures reveal the true nature of the nucleon, as GPDs allow us to depict hadrons as extended objects composed\nof quarks and gluons. Another exciting feature of GPDs is their relation to the QCD energy-momentum tensor,\nproviding its only experimental connection practicable today. This unique relation allows us to evaluate the total\nangular momentum carried by gluons or quarks of a given ﬂavor [251], which is essential to solve the long-standing\nproblem of the nucleon spin decomposition.

Phenomenological extraction of GPDs from DVCS\nNowadays, the main source of information on GPDs comes from deeply virtual Compton scattering (DVCS). This\nprocess is relatively simple in its interpretation, as the only non-perturbative object entering its amplitudes, which\nare referred to as Compton form factor (CFFs), are GPDs. DVCS has been extensively studied during the last two\ndecades and we refer to Ref. [263] for putting these developments into a phenomenological context. In view of the\nperspective open by future colliders and the lattice QCD progress, we focus here on GPD or CFF extractions from\nDVCS measurements. So far most of the phenomenological eﬀort in the GPD community has followed three directions:\n1. Consider data sets as samples of DVCS observables over many kinematic bins. Perform independent ﬁts on\nkinematic bins (as many ﬁts as kinematic bins).\n2. Build GPD or CFF models and compare them to existing data, possibly adjusting some of their parameters to\nobtain better agreement between model expectations and measurements.\n3. Build GPD or CFF parameterizations and adjust all their parameters to existing data.\nApproach 1 is commonly referred to as local ﬁts. It was ﬁrst presented in Ref. [264] and was used in numerous\nsubsequent studies [265–269]. The advantage of this method is that it is quite easy to implement and has a low-model\ndependence. Unfortunately, it provides information only on the kinematic bins where data are available, i.e. it does\nnot have any predictive power.

In addition, local ﬁts do not\nallow to incorporate theoretical constraints on GPDs, suggesting for instance the continuity of CFFs. Consequently\nmore sophisticated extractions of CFFs recently combined local ﬁts with kinematic corrections [270, 271], Rosenbluth\nseparation [272] or even parametric global ﬁts [273–277].\nApproach 2 corresponds to, e.g., the GK model [278–280], the VGG model [281–284], or the reggeized diquark\nmodel [189, 285–287]. Even if these models provide GPDs deﬁned over the whole ( xB,t,Q 2) kinematic domain, they\nusually do not provide a good agreement to the existing DVCS data. The lack of ﬂexibility of these models if often\nsignaled by a χ2/ndf ≫1. However, these physically-motivated parameterizations are valuable to making forecasting\nstudies or to designing future experiments, since they can be used in event generation to obtain sensible mock data.\nAn on-going theoretical eﬀort now provides wide families of GPD models which consistently address polynomiality\nand positivity properties. This allows robust predictions of new processes in as yet unexplored kinematic domains,\nlike, e.g., DVCS oﬀ a pion target at the EIC [288, 289].\nApproach 3, commonly referred to as global ﬁts, has been achieved by the KM and PARTONS groups [269, 290–\n292], however only for CFFs."}

Hard exclusive processes and multi-channel analysis\nMulti-channel analyses are necessary because they constitute universality checks of GPDs, provide diﬀerent handles\non the partonic content of the nucleon, and may avoid the aforementioned uniqueness issue of the DVCS deconvolution\nproblem [296]. Most of the existing data come either from DVCS or DVMP. Since these two (families of) processes\nhave diﬀerent coeﬃcient functions, a study at the GPD-level is mandatory. On the contrary, TCS occupies a special\nplace in multi-channel analyses. Its intimate relation to DVCS makes possible a joint study of DVCS and TCS at the\nCFF-level, see e.g., Ref. [297]. The ﬁrst TCS measurements were made by CLAS [298].\nHowever, most of the multi-channel studies made so far for DVCS, DVMP, or TCS and in various kinematic domains\nwere produced using models of approach 2 above. There are fewer studies with the ﬂexible ﬁt parameterizations of\napproach 3 (KM and PARTONS).

The constraints on A and J\nreﬂect the fact that the total momentum and angular momentum of the hadron are carried by their constituents,\nrespectively.

With the advances in experimental techniques, and theory development over time, jets have become\npowerful tools for exploring the fundamental properties and regimes of QCD, and when searching for unexpected\nphenomena in high-energy collisions [327–329]. This has pushed jet physics to the forefront of phenomenology at the\nLHC and RHIC.\nWhile jets are familiar in high-energy physics analyses, and appear in many diﬀerent guises, jets at the EIC can add\nimportant pieces of the puzzle on top of insights gained at hadron-hadron machines: Jets at EIC are naively expected\nto be very “clean”, i.e. little energy is not associated with the jets. However, the jets themselves contain relatively few\nparticles, and the particles have moderate energies. This oﬀers unique challenges and opportunities: Every particle\nis precious and diﬀerences between jet algorithms or substructure methods can become very apparent, while at the\nsame time, underlying event contamination (that continues to be a major challenge at the LHC) will be much smaller.\nThis already makes an assessment of jet properties at EIC an exciting theoretical and experimental prospect.

Related observables have recently been proposed at the EIC to probe interesting aspects of\nperturbative QCD, hadronization, cold nuclear matter eﬀects and gluon saturation [372, 384–392] in eAcollisions. A\nfrequently studied class of observables are jet angularities which characterizes the radiation pattern inside jets [393,\n394]. A continuous parameter is used to interpolate between diﬀerent traditional jet shape observables. In the left\npanel of Fig. 33, we show EIC predictions for an example of the jet angularities which coincides with the jet mass [382].\nThe development of jet grooming techniques [395, 396] has lead to a whole range of new jet substructure observables.\nInitially, jet grooming was introduced as a tool to systematically re"}

In addition, jet grooming lead to the development of a whole range of new\nobservables which can only be deﬁned on a groomed jet and which probe interesting aspects of perturbative and\nnonperturbative physics. Examples include the groomed jet mass, the groomed jet radius [396, 397] and the groomed\nmomentum sharing fraction which is a direct probe of the QCD splitting function [398]. At the EIC these observables\ncan be studied in a clean environment which was explored in Refs. [347, 383]. Moreover, in Ref.

Monte Carlo and Machine Learning\nGeneral-purpose Monte-Carlo event generators are a cornerstone of high-energy physics research, as they allow to\nsimulate events at particle colliders fully diﬀerentially in the many-body phase space [411]. These tools simulate the\nhighest-energy scattering that may seed the emergence of jets, the renormalization group evolution of the scattering by\nmeans of soft/collinear radiation that leads to the structure of jets, and the fragmentation of low-energy partons that\nproduces the hadrochemistry of the jets and the scattering event as a whole. Programs like Herwig [412], Pythia [413]\nand Sherpa [414] have been developed over the past decades (after the end of the main HERA programme) alongside\nmany experimental discoveries, and have been extended and reﬁned to describe the phenomena observed at lepton-\nlepton, lepton-hadron and hadron-hadron colliders.

Unfolding in high number of dimensions\nDiﬀerential cross section measurements are performed by applying methods to remove detector distortions called\nunfolding. Traditionally, these methods act on histograms. A histogram can be represented as a vector and one can\nthen transform the measurement problem into a linear algebra problem: ⃗T = R⃗D, where ⃗T is the target particle-level\nhistogram, R is the response matrix, and ⃗D is the detector-level histogram. Typically, measurements are limited\nto a ﬁxed O(1)-O(10) number of bins. This means that one dimension can be ﬁnely measured, or multi-diﬀerential\nobservables can be measured only coarsely. Recently, this limitation has been tackled by employing machine-learning\ntechniques: A new method called OmniFold [458] used deep learning to achieve unbinned unfolding in any number of\ndimensions[459].\nThe OmniFold algorithm is presented schematically in Fig. 36. The procedure proceeds by iteratively unfolding\nreweighting various datasets. The ﬁnal result is a set of particle-level Monte Carlo (MC) events with a set of weights.\nIn this way, one can choose any binning after the measurement in order to represent the data as a histogram.

HEAVY FLAVORS AT EIC\nEditors: Xin Dong, Stephen Sekula, Ivan Vitev.\nOpen and hidden heavy-ﬂavor production in deep-inelastic scattering beneﬁts from a status review of the tools and\nunderlying theory in order to ensure precise predictions for future EIC experiments. Heavy ﬂavor is a powerful tool\nin deep inelastic scattering that provides complementary and, in many cases, unique information on the heavy quark\nand gluon content of individual nucleons and whole nuclei.\nThe range of potential measurements, observations, or targets of opportunity is signiﬁcant in this sector. For\nexample, the EIC will provide the possibility to establish precision information about heavy-ﬂavor content of nucle-\nons/nuclei. For example, the strange-quark parton contribution — ”strangeness” — can be accessed via charged-\ncurrent reactions. The production of open heavy ﬂavor and quarkonia has emerged as a set of premier probes of\nnuclear matter; these approaches can shed light on the transport properties of large nuclei and the underlying physics\nof hadronization. At lower transverse momenta and in both polarized and unpolarized reactions at the EIC, heavy\nquark production has already been shown to be sensitive to TMD physics. To ensure the precise measurement of\nheavy ﬂavor, new developments in detector technology and analysis techniques are also needed. Highlighted below\nare some of the theoretical and experimental opportunities on the road to the EIC.\n5.1.

It is\nessential to establish and utilize an appropriate scheme, or schemes, for choosing how and which quark ﬂavors to\nincorporate in diﬀerent calculations. This issue is addressed by the development and adoption of diﬀerent ﬂavor\nnumber (FN) schemes, of which multiple have been proposed.\nHeavy-quark PDFs can be uniquely obtained by using the variable-ﬂavor-number (VFN) scheme, represented by\nthe following equations:\nfh+¯h(nf + 1,µ2) = Aps\nhq\n(\nnf, µ2\nm2\nh\n)\n⊗qs(nf,µ2) + As\nhg\n(\nnf, µ2\nm2\nh\n)\n⊗g(nf,µ2) , (5.1)\nqs(nf + 1,µ2) =\n[\nAns\nqq,h\n(\nnf, µ2\nm2\nh\n)\n+ Aps\nqq,h\n(\nnf, µ2\nm2\nh\n)\n+ Aps\nhq\n(\nnf, µ2\nm2\nh\n)]\n⊗qs(nf,µ2)\n+\n[\nAs\nqg,h\n(\nnf, µ2\nm2\nh\n)\n+ As\nhg\n(\nnf, µ2\nm2\nh\n)]\n⊗g(nf,µ2) , (5.2)\ng(nf + 1,µ2) = As\ngq,h\n(\nnf, µ2\nm2\nh\n)\n⊗qs(nf,µ2) + As\ngg,h\n(\nnf, µ2\nm2\nh\n)\n⊗g(nf,µ2) , (5.3)\nand one more relation in the non-singlet case, where all contributions are known even to three-loop order. The heavy-\nquark PDFs result from the massless PDFs above a matching scale µ≥mh. Furthermore, also the light-quark PDFs\nare modiﬁed.

This endeavor is enabled\nby a wealth of data from JLab experiments, RHIC and the LHC, that collectively help us reveal the details of the\nunderlying theory, QCD. The PDF framework has proven remarkably successful in describing processes with hadronic\ninitial states. While the study of proton PDFs has grown exceedingly precise, the need to extend this precision to the\nnuclear sector, involving ﬁts with explicit nuclear degrees of freedom, has become more urgent in recent years. The\nuse of nuclear targets and heavy ion collisions has continued and grown in recent decades, and a new era will open at\nthe EIC.

This provides 3-D imaging of the gluon’s motion.\nA recent work [355] is used to illustrate this approach. The TMD factorization formalism is developed for heavy\nﬂavor (HF) dijet production at the EIC.

This also included re-summation for small jet radii in electron-\nhadron reactions.\nIt was found that heavy ﬂavor-tagged jet production is more sensitive to the gluon and sea quark distributions in\nnucleons and nuclei in comparison to light jets. Thus, in kinematic regions where ReA is dominated by initial-state\nnPDF eﬀects the modiﬁcation was even stronger when compared to inclusive jets.\nAs in the case of light jets, by applying the strategy of studying ratios of the nuclear modiﬁcation with two diﬀerent\njet radii it is possible to eliminate nPDF eﬀects, primarily the anti-shadowing and the EMC eﬀect in the regions\nof interest. The remaining quenching of the jet spectra can be as large as a factor of two for small jet radii, for\nexample R = 0 .3, and can clearly be attributed to ﬁnal-state interactions and in-medium modiﬁcation of parton\nshowers containing heavy quarks. This suppression is comparable to the one predicted for light jets and expected to\nbe observed in the proton/nucleus going direction. This is illustrated in the left panel of Fig. 49.\nIn contrast, near the mid-rapidity region and at backward rapidity the deviation of ReA(R)/ReA(R = 0.8) from\nunity is small since the energy of the parton/jet in the rest frame of the nucleus is very large.

The results cited here show that the substructure modiﬁcation in e+A relative to\ne+p reactions is relatively small — on the order of 10% or smaller.

Since the discovery of quarkonia, three main production formalisms have\nbeen proposed: 1) the color evaporation model (CEM) [517, 518], 2) color singlet model (CSM) [519], and 3) the\neﬀective theory of non-relativistic-QCD (NRQCD) [520]. While all these frameworks enjoyed partial success, NRQCD\nis the only framework for which systematic corrections can be incorporated order-by-order in a rigorous manner.\nIn NRQCD, quarkonia are produced when the heavy-quark pair hadronizes into the colorless state with rates that\ndepend on the angular momentum and color conﬁguration of the pair. This is expressed in terms of long distance\n(non-perturbative) matrix elements (LDMEs) that need to be extracted from experiment and are considered universal.\nAt the EIC quarkonia can be produced either through photo-production ( Q2 ≃0) or lepto-production ( Q2 > 1\nGeV) processes. In these two cases the resolved, diﬀractive/exclusive, and inclusive productions (see Fig. 50(a), (b),\nand (c) respectively) can be relevant.

Summary\nOpen heavy-ﬂavor and quarkonium production in deep-inelastic scattering call for new developments in theory and\nexperiment to maximize the scientiﬁc output of the EIC. As heavy quarks introduce a new mass scale, the impact of\nﬂavor number schemes — ﬁxed-ﬂavor number (FFN) scheme and variable-ﬂavor-number (VFN) scheme —- on charm\nand bottom distributions has to be better understood.\nThe EIC will open new windows on our understanding of parton contributions to nucleons and nuclei. For example,\nvia neutral-current (NC) exchange in e+ p/A collisions at the EIC, heavy ﬂavor production can be used to probe\nthe initial gluon distributions inside nucleon and nucleus. This can be used to constrain the gluon (nuclear) PDF\nespecially in the large xB region. In the charged-current (CC) interaction channel with the scattered neutrino, heavy\nﬂavor and heavy ﬂavor jet production oﬀer the sensitivity to the strange quark sea. The interpretation of data from\nthese experiments may be complicated by a subtle interplay of power-suppressed corrections, as well as potential\ncontamination from target fragmentation. This requires signiﬁcant advances in theory predictions and associated\ntools in order to extract valuable information (e.g. gluon and sea quark PDFs) from future data. One critical issue\nto be addressed is how to distinguish nPDF eﬀects from other CNM eﬀects through the analysis of future EIC data\ntogether with the data on heavy-ﬂavor production at HERA and the LHC.\nMany ambiguities remain regarding the possible role of heavy quarks — particularly charm — in hadronic a"}

This phenomenon of gluon\nsaturation is a consequence of unitarity and can be quantitatively described by an eﬀective theory of Quantum\nChromoDynamics (QCD), the Color Glass Condensate [553–555]. Saturation eﬀects are important for all high-energy\ncollisions of hadrons and nuclei. They need to be taken into account for understanding particle production and\nmultiparticle correlations in proton-proton and proton-nucleus collisions at the LHC and at RHIC, especially at\nforward rapidities where one probes the smallest values of x in one of the colliding hadrons. Gluon saturation is an\nextremely important part of the heavy ion collision program that aims to produce and study deconﬁned QCD matter\nin high-energy heavy ion collisions. It is the key ingredient of our current theoretical understanding of the initial\nstage of the collision process, describing the production and equilibration of the matter that evolves to a quark-gluon\nplasma [556–558].\nWhile experimental data from a large variety of hadronic collision experiments are consistent with the presence of\nsaturation eﬀects, the theoretical interpretation of the experimental signals is always aﬀected by complexities inherent\nto QCD: hadronization and ﬁnal state interactions, in particular"}

Summary\nThe study of the small- x regime oﬀers unique discovery potential at the Electron-Ion Collider. At high energies\ngluon densities grow quickly, and it is expected that this growth is controlled by non-linear QCD eﬀects at suﬃciently\nsmall x, leading to saturation of the gluon density. Such gluon saturation could be deﬁnitively conﬁrmed in collisions of\nelectrons with heavy nuclei, for which we expect to reach the saturated regime atxvalues accessible at the Electron-Ion\nCollider. This is because electron-ion collisions oﬀer a cleaner and more controlled environment compared to nuclear\ncollisions, and the nuclear enhancement of the saturation scale oﬀers an important advantage over e+p collisions.\nFurther, a variety of observables with sensitivity to saturation are accessible in e+A collisions.\nThis includes structure functions, which are expected to be modiﬁed, compared to leading twist results, when\nsaturation eﬀects are included, and semi-inclusive observables, for example forward dihadron azimuthal correlations,\nwhich are expected to show a characteristic nuclear dependence, driven by saturation eﬀects. Furthermore, diﬀractive\nobservables can be particularly sensitive to saturation eﬀects, as they involve the exchange of at least two gluons,\nmaking them sensitive to the gluon distribution squared (at low"}
